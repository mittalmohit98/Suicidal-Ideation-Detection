It was bad. I would only wear long sleeved shirts. I had band aids on both of my wrists. I wore a wrist band on both wrists with a rubber band to hold it in place. I self harmed at one point every other day for months. I'd get this tunnel vision where i only could think of the sadness i felt. I really only had my one best friend that knew at that point. My best friend told my science teacher who i am thankful to this day for confronting me about it in private. She had me go to the school guidance counselor. Then a few more 'friends' well girls that i thought were my friends found out what i was doing and some got mad, some said i was doing it for attention. Things got worse before they got better. from then till i was 18 i just went on a downward spiral. I won't go into details but i was in the hospital for a week. After that i started self harming less and less. it started with once a week... once a month..once every two or three months... I still have the occasional rough day but i've learned safe alternatives. Safe ways to cope. Journal writing was one of the main things that helped me over the years. when i was really struggling in my late teens i'd write some times pages of just venting anger and frustration. the more i wrote the better i felt because it was off of my chest. as i self harmed less and less i wrote more. Somewhat of a back story (bullied at home and school growing up. parents divorced. stepfather picked on me. cyber bullied. disabled). I never thought i'd live to see 21. But now i'm 32.

I've barely ever used reddit but for some reason this sounded like a good idea. This is probably going to be a long rant so feel free to ignore this but I'm tired of suppressing everything and isolating myself. 

I don't even know where to begin. I'm not even sure whats keeping me going or why I'm even still breathing. The thought occurs to me daily if life is still worth living, if I should stick it out another day or just give up already. I always pick another day...I dont even have the slightest clue why anymore lol. I'm a depressed optimist I guess, what are the odds? 
I've been through so god damn much and it feels like life just enjoys piling more and more on because I apparently have a huge target on my back that says ""please sir, may I have some more""
I'm not good at...people. I can bullshit all day and do sales and customer service, but I have no real relationships. My friends are more like acquaintances and every intimate relationship I've had I feel like I've sabotaged. 
My first love, in high school, I intentionally made her hate me because I didnt know how to express my emotions and I knew that upset her and she deserved better. I intentionally hurt the first person I ever loved because I was too weak to tell her what I was feeling...who does that?! I honestly still kind of hate myself for it. She was such an amazing girl and was responsible for some of the best memories of my life and I repaid her by treating her like shit until she broke up with me because I thought she'd be happier...ugh. After that, I broke down. All I could do was cry and dwell on my own thoughts. I suppose I learned something from it though which at first was really helpful but then turned into my downfall. That first experience with love is so addicting. I was so broken because I didn't know how itd be possible to go on without her. Learning that you don't actually need anyone was empowering, but it eventually became enslaving. 
I spent about two years after that in my own little world. Occasionally living out of my car or going back and forth between family members houses, no one ever really caring what I was doing. I didn't think I'd be capable of feeling again the way I did with my ex, but I was wrong. I met a girl at a friends graduation party. We were both really drunk and there was an instant attraction between us. She came onto me, I had no idea what I was doing but I didn't want it to stop. One thing led to another and we ended up hooking up in my Chevy Aveo (logistically, I still don't know how considering I'm 6'3"" and that car felt like it was a clown car) It was my first and only random hookup. I remember telling her I didn't have protection, she said it didn't matter, we were both too drunk to be responsible. After we were finished and both lying naked I remember she looked at my necklace for the first time and asked me what it was. I wear a medical alert because on top of everything else I'm also diabetic. Me being drunk though and thinking it'd be hilarious, told her it was a medical alert, but then I added it was for AIDS. I got the shit smacked out of me lol but she realized I wasn't serious. I felt bad in the morning because I didn't want to leave it at that. Even after that horrible joke she was still really sweet, and warm, and loving, and I just didn't want to lose that feeling again. We exchanged numbers and actually dated for a while afterwards. It was fun, my few friends knew her as ""aids girl"" and I never lived that down, but we both kind of thought it was an incredibly unique story on how we met. Everything felt amazing again for the first time in what felt like forever. Then I got a message that said she was late. The thought wasn't even in my head as to what that really meant. When it finally hit me I didn't know to do. I was 20, she was only 17. Legally I could have been screwed. We had to tell her parents. I was terrified. Fortunately, her mom liked me so I was safe in that regard. I didn't know what to do about a kid though. She really was pregnant and apparently she also wasn't 100% who the father was. The time line fit perfectly with that first night we met and apparently the other guy only happened the night or so after, before we actually started really going out. The main difference though was that they used protection and we didn't. Honestly when she was said it was ok after I told her I didn't have any, I assumed that ment she was on the pill. So I was about 90% sure that the kid was mine at that point. I pushed for an abortion. Not because I didn't want a kid, I didn't know if I wanted one or not, but because she had her whole life ahead of her. She had her college plans laid out and a career path already in mind. I didn't want her to sacrifice that. I felt horrible talking her into it because she instinctively wanted to keep it right away. I did really like her though and I was happy when I was with her so I told her I supported her no matter what choice she made. She wanted to check her options so I drove her to the clinic out of state so she could talk with them to see if was something that she really wanted to do. The more I thought about it, the more I started to realize that I kind of wanted to be a father. I wanted to have someone that I could always take of. Someone to force me to be better so that I could provide for them. The more I thought about it, the better it sounded. She told me she had made up her mind and that I was right, she should get the abortion. I didn't know what to say considering I'd just made a complete 180. I tired to tell her that we'd be able to make it work if she kept it. I had already started job hunting for something better so I'd be able to take care of her and the child. Her mind was made up. I couldn't blame her, keeping the child ment she'd be sacrificing a lot. I had fallen in love with her at this point and just wanted to be by side either way. I thought it'd all work out okay. She got the abortion and said she needed space. I never really told her how I felt about her other than that I supported her. I didn't know that wasn't enough. I tried to talk to her again but she just said it felt weird being with me after the abortion and that it wasn't like she was my girlfriend. I didn't know what to say. We'd spent nearly every day together for months up until the abortion and she wasn't my girlfriend? I was speechless. True, I never asked her to be my girlfriend or gotten up the will to tell her I was falling in love with her, but after everything I did and tried to do for her and all the time we spent together I just assumed...I don't know why it's so hard for me to let people know how I feel. 
I fell into another long period of isolation, loathing everything about myself. After about another year and a half I worked up enough courage to try online dating. I met one or two girls that seemed really great but they all fizzled out after a date or two. I'm so fucking awkward on dates. Eventually I did meet someone though. I had been thinking about moving and getting the hell out of this god forsaken town in the middle of nowhere I've spent so much time in. I had family around Austin who volunteered to put me up for awhile if I wanted to move. At that point I said fuck it, changed my online profile to Austin to see if my options were any better. I met her shortly after and we instantly clicked online. I was starting to feel normal again, like there was a point to it all. We fell for each other quickly. She insisted on visiting me and I wasn't going to argue so she bought a plane ticket and flew up to stay with me for a few days in December. I picked her up from the airport and was so fucking nervous because I knew if I fucked up there was no where to run to until she flew back. It went great. She looked even better in person than in her pictures or on video chat. Those four days were fucking amazing! She had surprised me with early christmas presents. I fucking cried because no one has ever thought enough about me to do anything like that before and every gift was so thoughtful and perfect. Those four days were phenomenal, we barely left my room the entire time and my face actually hurt from smiling because literally every moment with her was perfect. I drove her back to the airport and actually cried on my drive home. I hadn't cried since after hurting my first ex in high school and I've already done it twice within four days of contact with this amazing woman. That drive home was heart wrenching because I couldn't know with certainty if I'd see her again. My mind was made up though, I was moving to Austin. She was everything I wanted and needed and I had a job that I could take with me so it was perfect. She flew up again to visit in January for a week. It was just as great. Her dog had recently passed though so she was upset about that and at one point she completely shut me out and kind of had a small break down after playing with my dog. I realized we were so fucking similar it was scary, but it felt perfect because I knew how to help her. I didn't know how I managed to finally get so lucky. My entire world looked bright and promising for the first time. She saw things in me that I never would have seen. I felt like anything was possible, that I was finally going to go back to school and get a degree, that the future was going to be the best years of my life because she was going to be in it. I made the move in March. Packed up everything I could fit into my tiny car, put my dog in the front seat and drove 28 hours cross country into my great new life....
Nothing went like I thought it would at all. My cousin that I moved in with hated having people over and she lived with her parents while finished her last year of college. They also hated having people over. We had no where to go to spend time with each other. Our dates turned into fights. She didn't like making decisions and I had no idea what my options even were when we went out because the entire city was foreign to me. My cousin kept passive aggressively trying to get me to move out. I was still making decent money thanks to my tech support job I was able to take with me but the cost of living was there was ridiculous compared to where I came from. I brought up the idea of getting a place together because when she visited me at my place and it was just us it was amazing. I wanted to have that again, I thought we needed that again. She actually didn't like the idea because of a bad experience with an ex. I kind of felt betrayed. Our relationship continued to strain, I kept getting pressured to move out, my job started getting more and more stressful. I didn't know how everything turned so bad so quickly. 
I'd been making progress with my emotions. I was finally able to tell her what I was feeling, but ironically she was having trouble telling me. She stopped talking to me. I was alone. In a new city. Lost. How the fuck did this happen? I finally got fed up with the pressure and found a roommate online so I could move out. I got sick of my job because I was just stressed out all the time when I even thought about work. I moved into a shitty little apartment with some shitty alcoholic sports fanatic with anger issues. I quit my job and ended up job hopping about every 4 weeks. All I had was my dog. My roommate started to turn psychotic so eventually my own apartment didn't even feel safe anymore. I'd wander the streets with my dog for hours at night just trying not to think about how shitty everything had become. I tried to go out and enjoy the city. Thankfully there was a lot more to do there than back home. Occasionally went to bars, concerts, or festivals completely by myself. It was fun but it was hollow. What good are life experiences when you have no one to share them with? As much as I tried to avoid it, I was falling back into that pit of despair. The jobs I had were mostly crap and I struggled to get by. Hell, half the time I couldn't even afford my own insulin. Being depressed sucks. Being a depressed diabetic with no money to afford the medication required to keep you alive? Seriously, why the fuck am I still alive? HOW am I still alive? 
After about a year of being completely on my own in Austin I eventually made my way back home after things went critical with my shitty roommate. I've been back for over a year now and I think I'm probably in the worst spot of my entire life. The job market here is horrible and I'm lucky to make $300 in two weeks. I'm essentially homeless because my parents don't want me to stay at their place but allow it because I have no other options. I have friends who offer their couches occasionally but I always feel like I'm imposing or over staying my welcome. None of my so called friends even know a portion of what I've been through or even care to find out. I have no one to lean on. No one to fall on. No one to pick me up and help me find my feet again. I've never felt more like a complete failure before in my life. I have way too much free time and get stuck reliving every damn mistake I've ever made. I just want to feel love again...Learning that I don't need anyone other than myself to survive may have been completely wrong because I'm not sure I can keep going on alone",depression,t5_2qqqf,I just need...to feel like I matter to someone

My best friend is sitting next to me, we're all talking and having a good time. I look over to her, and my friend next to her has his hand on her thigh. I just thought that was pretty normal, since he's that kind of guy just to do it to anyone. But it continued. And they were having really private, under the table type of discussions that I just happened to notice. 

So I ask her about it. She's been dating this wonderful guy for two years, and I thought they were a dead set couple. But I guess I was just left in the blue as she goes on to tell me that she broke up with him four months ago and that these two have been dating since the start of the year. 

I feel pretty happy for her, since she's with someone better and more for her. I just feel terrible that I was just left in the blue about this. Being her best friend, I thought I would be there to help her when she's down and get excited when she's up. But no. I guess I'm just left with that as it is.

to give some backstory: i am a 16 year old boy, currently in 11th grade and going to take my SATs soon. 

as such my grades are extremely important and i need to do well on my SATs
my parents are INDIAN and very very obsessed with my grades. i am in all AP/honors classes and i get decent grades (a/bs). i think its important to note that they are indian because where they are from beating children is a normal and ok thing to do

for over 10 years, my parents physically beat me for hours on end when i do something they dont like. recently, when i study less than they want me to they do things like slapping my face, hitting my body, kicking, etc. they also come into my room and block the door so i cant escape. this happens every 2 weeks or so

usually they leave me crying after abusing me like this, and after they cool down they act all sorry and happy. it used to cheer me up when i was younger, but now i know its just an act and in a week or two they are going to do it again.

the thing is, i feel like i am not doing things very wrong. i study for 4-5 hours PER DAY, and while i love to play video games i only play it after my schoolwork is done for the next day.

i am posting this after a very brutal incident of this. i did some sat practice in the morning and then i decided to play some video games since i have the day off tomorrow. this is not enough for them and they repeatedly yelled at me before beating me again. luckily i managed to escape to my room and i am typing this from there.

a lot of my parents anger stems from the fact that i like to play video games. they say that it is the cause of all problems and if i didnt play then i would be a perfect student. they dont understand that my stress comes from a fear of them..............

other sources tell me to call the police, but i dont want to do that. what will the police do?? will they take me away from my family?? even though i hate my parents i still depend on them

My Career? That's gotten screwed big time, Just of out university, and I start working at one of the country's most reputable software development houses as a Sys Admin. - Guess what? I hate my job, people are two faced, constantly lie to me and I'm overworked as hell. Then, we were taken over by KPMG, and this made things even worse. - I'm caught in a war between my company and KPMG to implement policies  - (This has been going on for the good part of 2 years). I'm also in a small three man team, 2 of them are 25 years older than me, and we're supposed to be supporting the IT problems of over 300 people. while handling this fucking take over, and the company doesn't want to bring more people over. 

I've lost my appetite for all the things I used to love to do, (gaming, reading, travelling tinkering with cars etc...) - When I come home, I'm just a Zombie, that doesn't want to do anything but exist. 

I'm an Ugly, unfit person, who just cannot bear to look at himself in the mirror. My Back is also fucked (Spine is bent to the side Scoliosis), so I'm in agony almost all the time. 

I barely sleep well at all these days, and my thoughts are preoccupied with work (it's the only thing I have left, as I HAVE to work to pay the bills)

I still live with my aunt, I'll never be able to afford a place of my own.

My Dreams? 

My Dream Car (a VW Golf IV) Caused me nothing but grief, the Car I got to replace it (a VW Golf VI) Had it's roof cave in thanks to the blistering heat, Now I'm driving a Pitiful, and Characterless VW Polo that depresses me everytime I get into it (a Car Enthusiast's Coffin basically) 

My Aspirations to get a 1st Class Degree? Destroyed by my Family, (I have a Second Class one now, while my Brother, the one who helped me fuck up my aspirations cause of his fucking Dyslexia has a 1st Class Degree off my Back.)

My Brother? - Treats me like I'm a worthless shit. 

Friends? Every time I try to make friends, they always turn out to be fake and always want to use me. - I'm lonely, and forever doomed to be alone. 

Me? - I'm an unfit, Asperger's Syndrome Suffering worthless pile of shit (and using Shit is too polite a word) that can't get anything right. - I can't get normal life right for fuck's sake.

I never had a good childhood, cause my dad drilled it into my skull that I'm a worthless and useless pile of shit. he also got my brother to berate me, and he beat me up regularly. 

I just want to end it, I want all this pain to end. - No one loves me, they only pretend to. and no one cares about me. if I was gone within the next few seconds, I don't think anyone would notice. 

I don't know... I almost killed myself about 4 times in the last week and a half, but can't bring myself to do it.

Then, I just didn't understand why I kept binging on alcohol and DXM (robitussin). I thought it was just a curiosity issue turned addiction. 

I got meds and have been to a psychiatrist regularly since then. I was hospitalized in October because I kept trying to hurt myself with riskier and riskier binges. That behavior came back almost immediately.

I had a good 2 week stint without substances in January as I was keeping up with New Years and such. Well, I was still feeling bad. I hurt my shoulder one day and got a script for hydrocodone. 10 pills. I used 4 to have fun and test it out. I used he last 6 to try to kill myself. Nowhere near enough apparently. My ideal suicide has always been to OD on an opiate of some sort.

I told my counselor and psychiatrist. They both recommended intensive inpatient rehab to get my addiction problems out of the way. I never really considered myself as having an addiction, but I looked into it.

Well it is literally not possible to do that given my current schedule so I can't really have that as an option. In fact, the outpatient services aren't even feasible (in my last semester of grad school--it's an internship experience thing). 

I kept it clean for an entire month until last night without any rehab. The only reason I did it last night was because I felt terrible and thought the 6 pack might help or hurt or something. I still wouldn't describe it as an addiction but whatever.

I'm kinda fed up with the counseling and psychiatry at this point to be honest because nothing seems to be going better for me despite a lot of time and money.

My days typically go like this: wake up ready to do stuff, go do stuff, feel good about it, come home, and then slowly deteriorate mentally until by night I usually want to die. Literally die of course. Then I go to bed to restart the pattern.

I feel like my wife and babies would do better without me. I feel like I don't belong in the adult world ""adulting"". I feel like I just don't want to be here anymore.

And the worst part is I'm not sure I can give up the idea of suicide. To me, it's become how I'm pretty sure I'll die. It's what I want. Every day. Just death now. Why can't it happen?

Will this ever end? I don't think so but I know people will say it will. It sucks. It sucks because I don't have the courage to do it most of the time and then when I do I don't have the resources to do it in a non-messy and non-painful way.

I really need some input or some advice. I have been through a lot of shit in my life, but this on top of my depression is one of the heaviest. I don't know if I can take it anymore. I just need to rant somewhere and maybe someone has something useful to say. Thanks in advance.
About half a year ago I met a girl through a mutual friend. I had had a rough few months and was feeling very lonely. When she came into my life it couldn't have been timed better. She was like a saving angel out of nowhere. She told me that she had seen pictures of him and I, and always thought I was cute. I fell for her and we talked and flirted or at least had contact almost every day since then. For the first time in a long time I felt a lot better.

She would often tell me directly how fine I was, that she wanted to be with me and she would even joke about a future together. There is no way I could have misinterpreted what she said or meant. This was a major confidence boost for me at the time. I decided to invite her out. She said she didn't have time, but with good reason, so i didn't worry. Invited her out again, and the same thing happened again. The third time, with fear of putting her in a corner, I told her how much I liked her and tried to invite her out again. This time she explained how she wasn't ready to date and that she had too much else going on. This hit me hard.

Skip till today and she still talks to me every now and then. I know my happiness shouldn't rely on other people, but it does. I get happy whenever I hear from her, but I quickly realize that there is not going to be anything between us. Without her everything is worse than before I met her. Looking back at how she flirted makes it hurt even more. I just can't understand it. She was the one that wanted to take contact with me in the first place and now I'm the one getting damaged by her. I also know there are other people out there, but it doesn't help right now. I see her everywhere and she is the most beautiful person I have ever seen.

I do not mean to talk bad about her in any way. She seems very nice and caring and I haven't told her about my condition. I just don't understand how she could make it seem like she wanted me so bad and reject me when I invite her out. The last few months hearing from her has been the only joy in my life, so how do I go on now? How do I deal with the only thing I want from life right now being out of reach?

The best thing for me would probably be to cut all contact with her, but i don't know how or if I can do that. I am a bit drunk right now, and want to write to her, but that's not a good idea. I'm thinking of just ending it all. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Depression + unrequited love = the worst pain

 I dont really know how to do this or who im talking to but ive always felt better after talking to people and I feel like people I know are ignoring me because theyre sick and tired of me complaining, which is a little ironic because all I talk about is how sick and tired I am of everything including complaining. I dont actually know if thats ironic, though. 

I guess ill tell you that things are pretty bad. My univeesity isnt a good one, and theyre thinking of doing something to my department that will make my degree worthless. Even though im in my first year. Of a five year degree. I liked my first semester but I cant seem to make myself like this one. The teachers are bad, no one to talk to, my only good friends and people I talk to I ration my conversations with so I dont bug them too much. That doesnt really work out because they thjnk im just quiet so they let me be and talk to each other more. I want them to talk to me I just cant think of stuff to say thats not sad or depressing or whiney. Im sure if they ever saw this or I told them theyd feel guilty and talk to me so I dont want that either. 

Did I tell you I love one of them? Well I love both of them, but im in love with one of them, romantically. Shes amazing. Shes just so great its amazing. The only person that comes to my mind when I think of someone that I can spend the rest of my life with is her. Its not baseless infatuation thats gotten to the point of obsession, because that's happened to me before and I remember nothing actually feeling right. With this girl its practical, it makes sense, and I know itd be amazing to be loved by her. I wish I was. I love that she loves my other friend, because I love him no less than myself, in fact a lot more because I dont particularly like myself and do love him a lot. I like that they're together but not together. I still wish I was hers though. 

So theres that too. I also have an ex girlfriend. I lied to her I guess. I made her believe I loved her more than I did, through my actions. She thought id wanted to marry her. She couldnt believe I wanted to break up. Shes a mess too. I wish I could help her but my inability to commit to someone I need to take care of and do a lot for hinders me. And ive lost feeling for her. I cant do much without that. She still loves me though. She messages me from time to time. Shes a strong girl, shes not delusional. She knows we're not getting together. Shes dealing with it. Shes a good person.

Theres also my university, yeah. Or more about it, I guess. I wish I could leave it. If I graduate from here, it will be on the back of my parents, and my job will then be on the back of my family and everything will be tied to them. I dont want thay at all. I think my family and I are two separate entities that should be left to their own devices. My family has contributed a lot to where I am now, in both ways that are good and bad.

At the start things were wonderful, but he's slowly been pulling away and he seems like a completely different person now.

I've had depression in the past but I still have no clue what to do. When I feel down most of the time I open up to people and talk about what's bothering me ... but he just shuts down. I have low self esteem so for a while I thought maybe he just didn't like me anymore, or that he'd found someone else ... I feel awful about this but I've gotten angry at him a few times, asking why he hardly talked to me anymore and saying that I wish things were like the beginning again. He says it's because he's stressed and depressed and I'm trying to believe that (instead of just blaming myself for everything).

I want to be there for him if he ever wants to open up to me, but the amount of times I've gotten 'mad' at him for being so distant... I'm worried I've just pushed him away too much :( His ex cheated on him in the past, and I'm pretty sure that's a big reason why he's reluctant to open up to me... because he doesn't want to be hurt again.

I try to message him nice stuff throughout the day, but he doesn't always reciprocate (which I don't mind), but does that mean he doesn't want that? He seems to be sleeping all the time and always forgets to eat. He's got a lot of uni work as well so he's doing that a lot. I'm normally the one who asks to hang out, and I only really see him once a week now... if it was up to him it'd probably be less frequent. 

I just don't know what to do to help him. I feel like he doesn't like me anymore, but I hope that's not true. I've told him I want to break up with him a few times because it just feels like he doesn't care about me. I feel quite unloved and lonely at the moment, but I still want to try and be there for him as much as possible without putting too much pressure on him (I've already put a lot on him).

What can I do to help? I care about him so much and really want him to be happy. We connected so well at the start, and I really miss how happy he used to be. It hurts so much to see him like this.

Nothing can ever make the pain go away, why should I continue living like this when I have the power to free myself?

I've had a few suicide attempts before, and I guess that each time a tiny part of me wanted to be saved, last week that part was almost non existent, and now it's disappeared completely. Tomorrow evening when I feel like I can slip away from my house, I will. I'll go round to the shop that's near me, I'll buy a bottle of water but steal 10 packets of paracetamol (16 per pack so 160 tablets) and then I'll walk to the nearest train station, which I would say is about an hour away and I guess I'll just sit on the tracks and wait to die. I think I'll probably take the tablets as soon as I can though incase I change my mind, I'm hoping that an overdose of 160 tablets will be pretty hard to fix. I have my suicide note ready to go, I'll bring it with me rather than leaving it in my room. If my mum were to see it sitting there she would phone the police straight away, and I want to have that delayed for as long as possible so that I can't be found.

I also have SLE and I'd like to get reevaluated for ADHD-PI (unfortunately every time I got screened the pros always said it was my MDD and GAD that was clouding my brain, but I really do think ADHD medication will help me focus).

I really wish I could take a break from life and work on all my health issues. I feel like I can't though, because I spent most of my high school days in bed at home and went through a remedial program my senior year to get my diploma on time. My family says now I have to continually apply myself and be in college full-time, that I had enough time to ""screw around"" in high school. 

The last few years, I noticed I don't have problems with easy classes, but when I take a difficult class like biology, chemistry, calculus, accounting...all my symptoms trigger.
So for the most part I haven't been getting treatment since graduating high school because I've been doing all right. Now I think I haven't solved my issues really. Though, I'm not sure if there is a cure for disorders?

Other reasons why I feel like I can't are because everyone else is moving forward and if I stop I'll be moving backwards. Everyone around me is graduating, getting jobs, leadership, internships, scholarships, awards, etc. I only have enough energy to attend class and put in enough effort to complete assignments and projects.

Hello everyone. This is basically going to be honest thoughts on twelve years of existing with depression, alongside various other mood disorders. 

I'm currently 17 (turning 18 shortly), so have had these illnesses stemming back from a harmful childhood. I have my up and down periods, but mainly down, and recently i got reflecting on it all. 

Over the years I've had tons of medications and therapists to try and help me handle it but it never really helped me to beat depression, just to learn to live with it, which isn't what I want. I want to beat this illness that has me shackled with such heavy chains. Somedays i get a glimpse of how life is without this illness and it is beyond beautiful, i want to see that every day.

However after so many different treatments I've been wondering if I am the problem? Like, were my expectations of life in the aftermath just too high? Did i expect too much and that's why i dont seem to ""beat"" it? I'm starting to doubt myself after a nurse sat me down in hospital and called me a delusional liar who wants to be in pain for attention, despite hating all attention I get. (Very cruel to say to a person who admits to having severe anxiety the day before).

If anyone doesn't have depression, how would you describe life without it? I need to know if im the issue here, if so I'll try to change even more.

I've had some pretty extreme stuff happen to me, so there going to be more than this. I have a lot to share. And forgive me for sounding so negative. I'm having extreme struggles right now, as my life has been a total cluster, plus I have a very strong self-loathing due to these events. I am trying to stay strong. I just haven't been able to recover from some of these events, and they damaged me in such a way it changed who I was dramatically.
Before I go into the story, I just want to explain something necessary to the story, and about myself, and who I am. This happened when I was 11, and I'm 17 now. I'm a Autistic, very depressed, suicidal, introverted teenager, who spends most of his time working than having fun, because I really don't like being around other people, all because of the events that transpired as I grew up. My childhood was destroyed when I was five, when I was abducted at my school and was molested and sexually tortured by an older man, who almost came back for me once. I am a very beautiful child, according to everyone, although I choose not to accept it. Because of how attractive I am, I usually get a lot of attention by girls at school, and unfortunately another unwanted coward. Several times, older pedophiles have harassed me, touched me, one other even stuck his hands in my pants when I wasn't paying attention.
But this occurred several years ago. I was with my family at a tire store, as they were making a payment for a recent set of tires put on. I decided to come in with her, because my brother and dad were arguing in the car. Several Chairs were just to the right of the door. Only three people were there. One of them was a very shady man, in his 50's, wearing a tan fishing shop t-shirt, khaki cap, and jeans. His hair was grey and in a ponytail. He had horrible teeth. While my mom was talking to the cashier, I noticed this man staring at me. I already was feeling uncomfortable, because this was so common for me to deal with, if anyone looked at me, I started to loose it. He reminded me of the man who abused me when I was five. I hid, and noticed he leaned out more slightly to try and see me behind were I was, although he was still sitting. I felt really scared now, so I tried to go back to the car.
As a walked past him (he was sitting near the door) he immediately put his hand on my arm. He then said ""Hey, Baby..."" In a very malicious tone, as if I was his spouse. I asked him what he wanted. He said I looked sexy, and he wanted a piece of me. Holy Fuck. I didn't scream or get my moms attention though, because he had a very weak grip on me, and if he grabbed me, I knew where to aim so he could release me. I really did want to tell someone, but I was nervous because of my father, who would literally beat this guy senseless and had a violent temper, because even if this guy had malicious intentions, my father would be too much of a lesson for him to learn.

I was terribly effected by this incident. I was so upset, I attempted suicide several days later. But that failed. But, as of now, I still am very distraught about that incident.

I am not a grandiose megalomaniac, with designs for great prosperity at your expense. I am not the chaotic demon, seeking destruction for its own sake. I am not the corporate shill, nor the philanderer.

I am the villain in that my words make me seem worthwhile, and my thoughts show me not to be. I am loneliness, the isolated. I am friendships lost for distance and time. I am kindness turned to apathy. I am abandonment, I am the lost histories, I am fear borne of ignorance of current circumstances. I am why you cry at night. I am where your heart lies when you know that no one likes you. I am the future, I am the past.

My nemesis is love. Love, that reaches out to others, that brings us together. His obsession with destroying my walls, walls of ""comfort,"" walls of ""anxiety"" and ""fear"" and ""cynicism"" that I erected long ago to protect you from heartache... this obsession harms me. Pain is natural to life. Connection is not.

I have such power because I can be so easily destroyed, so I seperate people with fear of being hurt, fear of judgement, I use friendship and hatred, I force love into desperation which he harms people with, or lowers perceived worth.

Loneliness rules us all. Not through technological isolation; though the smartphone is a powerful tool for me, it is also a tool for him. Love can reach from further away than ever before with this, and I can make you lose yourself in a world of memes and ideology.

Nor through an increased sense of misanthropy. There will always be those who hate each other, and the society I have constructed requires not reaching out, placing economic worth in one hand and social worth in the other.
So I make you build the wall. Because there's ultimately no chance of attaining the lost happiness. There is no hope. There is only isolation, fear, anxiety, sadness, and ultimately, the end.

gearnut,,,1456518621,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/47r4qp/i_have_so_many_questions_running_through_my_mind/,47r4qp,True,0,False,1459219036,3,"I've realised that I rambled a bit when I posted this last night so I've put a TL;DR with the questions at the end.

3 weeks ago I found out that my mother had been sexually abused (from my great aunt who has always been sympathetic to my mother, but it is the simplest explanation for a lot of things in my childhood, suffice to say I believe her) as a child by her father who had been neglected (deprived of food and forced to sleep in a kennel). When I was a child she allowed her boyfriend of 7.5 years to violently abuse me. It feels as though my entire life has been overshadowed by PTSD. I am only 23, this cycle of abuse has been rumbling away for nearly 100 years (possibly more depending on what happened to my great grandfather as a child), obviously the idea of facing up to something like this is rather daunting. Can people please offer some advice on breaking the cycle?

Finding out about my mother's abuse seems to have massively destabilised me, previous situations which have done so have all been something which had a definite end, I feel like I need to speak to my mum about this but don't even understand what to say to her (we haven't talked in nearly 5 years), where do you even begin with this kind of thing? Frankly I just feel disappointed that I told her what I was dealing with once I had moved to my dad's, by this point she was very much aware of her own abuse and her only excuse was that she was ill. 

I would someday like to have a family (I do not plan on introducing children into any relationship until I have my disorder completely under control, I recognise this is likely a long way off and am ok with that), I refuse to perpetuate what has happened to the previous 2 generations of my family. Having learnt about my mother's abuse (and what sounds horribly like PTSD from dissociated memories) a nagging idea has been sat in the back of my mind that if she was responsible I would never have been born, it would be tremendously hypocritical of me to take responsibility for a child without being very confident that my disorder would not expose them to danger or fear.

I have realised that with one exception (a highly abusive relationship where my partner was actually cheating on someone else with me and had been diagnosed with Schizophrenia with which I gave her a lot of support, not really a normal or healthy relationship) I have never been able to make a relationship work, of the four which I have had 2 have been ended by the lady in question the day after the first date and one which was with my best friend at the time 3 days after we'd met up for the first time since getting together (it was a long distance thing). It has been mentioned by a very good friend of mine that I can be a little bit ""smothering"" and that this may have something to do with it, obviously getting myself stable and happy will help with this but what else can I do to not frighten people away?

I met someone recently and realised that there were moments where I was clinging to her like a life boat in a storm, she has been amazingly supportive but only after we had agreed to see if a relationship could work out and then immediately broke up with me the next day saying that she had only just broken up with her ex, about 2 weeks later she told me that she wasn't physically attracted to me but was happy to be good friends and for us to spend lots of time cuddling each other, this was fine until she met someone else who she is now going out with (I really want to be happy for her but it does mean that our friendship will have to change to accommodate it). It kind of feels as though relationships just open me up to pain, should I just stay away from them for now? How do I know when I am ready to seriously take a stab at a relationship? I feel as though I need an intimate but none sexual relationship, this is what I thought I had found with this person but obviously I misread it completely.

My family seems to drop bomb shells on me at ridiculous times, my great aunt initially told me about my mother's abuse the week before my final university exams when I was seriously struggling with my PTSD due to having seen someone seriously injure themselves, I simply refused to acknowledge what had happened to my mum as I couldn't cope with the knowledge.

How would I go about finding a good councillor in the UK? I currently feel as though I am being pissed about by the NHS because the receptionists don't actually give 2 fucks about the patient's safety/ happiness if they can't meet all of the little rules (I moved house last week while waiting for a referral from my old GP, now out of her catchment area so the receptionist had no interest in helping). If necessary I am willing to pay for private counselling but wouldn't know where to begin getting a recommendation for someone that is good and I don't particularly want to have to go through the process of explaining what happened to me again and again until I find someone good. (I live in Derby in the UK, if anyone by coincidence knows a good therapist/ counsellor nearby please do point me in their direction).

I feel like the 8 year old who had his perception of reality and love shattered, despite all of the amazing things going on in my life and the wonderful people I have the privilege of calling my friends I feel frightened and alone, I don't even know how to ask my friends for help with this stuff. I just want to be happy again, I have seen glimpses of it on a few occasions but it feels like everything is falling apart at the moment.

I'm sorry this has been so long, there are yet more questions running through my mind but I can't figure out how to put them into words.

**TL;DR: Do people have any advice to offer about breaking a cycle of abuse? Stories from people who have done this would help me I think. **

How are you supposed to deal with big family revelations? I'm talking about finding out that your mother who facilitated your abuse was abused as a child herself kind of stuff. I feel that I need to talk to her but don't know where to begin, how do other people handle this?

I seem to get very close to people very quickly in relationships and it tends to scare them off, is there some way in which I can manage this and get myself to slow down?

Every time I get close to having a relationship it seems that my PTSD becomes destabilised, almost as though I'm afraid of the idea of being happy (at the end of the day all I want is to be happy with my life, I have so many amazing things going on, the only thing stopping it is my PTSD), any suggestions on how I can let myself be happy?

The NHS has been utterly useless in providing me with any long term treatment as I have been moving around a lot lately due to finishing uni, starting a new job, feeling incredibly unsafe in my old house share. Hopefully if I get my counselling started before I have to move again they'll stop messing me around.",ptsd,t5_2qm0x,"I have so many questions running through my mind, help?"

In the car, he decides to ask me ""what the fuck is my problem"" as I haven't really been able to get out of bed and have barely been getting my homework done for the past few weeks or so. 

I don't say much, so he starts rattling off all the things that he 'knows' are bothering me (no drivers' license, my mom being just awful all the time, no money at home, I hate the school I'm going to, etc). I stop him and try to tell him a few things that are on my mind, so he responds by telling me to stop being a little bitch and complaining about everything all the time. Motherfucker you ASKED me what was wrong...so after that I realize I'm not going to get anywhere with him and just clam up and don't say anything for the rest of the car ride home. 

He feels super guilty for the rest of the night and makes me dinner, tries to pay me back money he owes me ($10 out of $600-something, LMAO) and tries to be super nice.

Now I've realized just how selfish my parents are. The only reason he tried to fix what he did is so I will keep giving him money when he needs it. But no matter what happens I still will cause I can't take the guilt trips that I get from him and my mom when I say no.

I hate my parents so much guys. They do everything for a selfish reason. They're nice to me only when the need money or a favor. My dad has been living through me ever since I was little (coaching all my sports teams, getting extremely involved in the church I play music at), and the only reason my parents want me to succeed is so I can get a good job and provide for them when they can't work anymore, since both my brothers will not and they know it.

I've made it pretty clear to my dad that I want to switch to public school because of the toxic environment that I have to step into every day (been kicked off of all my clubs/activities because I don't believe in God, teachers tell me I'm going to burn in hell, students shun me for my beliefs).

The bottom line is he doesn't really care. The only reason he said he would do something anyways is because I made a vague reference to killing myself and he picked up on it. 

Also, the couple friends that I have just seem like they don't give a fuck anymore.

**Does anyone else feel like they NEED something or someone to make them able to function, and without it they are just dead?** 
It's hard to explain, but I'll try. I've been struggling with depression for so long. Before, to not dwell on it I would play videos games. Then I stopped being able to play video games because I realized how pointless they were. I just can't play them without feeling like total shit. Then it was books. but I just got to the point where I can barely read anymore. Without hobbies like this to look forward to doing I can't even function, but when I try to enjoy them I can't do that either.

Now recently I fucked up and something happened I tried to avoid. I haven't been in a relationship and I never thought about one before much either, because I knew I don't have the means of being in one right now and I don't want to get hurt. So I just avoided thinking about it. Well recently I was in the hospital and I met a girl. She is really cool and I've been talking to her quite a bit. Well I made the mistake of hoping something could happen between us, but the more I talk to her the more I realized it won't. She obviously just wants to be friends, and I thought I would be ok with this. I hate that now I'm so upset about it. I knew from the start the chances of anything happening were like zero, and I knew she probably just wanted someone else to talk to that is struggling with depression. I can't believe I let myself think otherwise. Now I'm afraid this is the new thing that will keep me from be able to function. I'm afraid that I realized how lonely I am and want a relationship badly. But there's just no way I can see that happening right now.

im 13. im mentally ill. im a transgender male whos parents wont accept him.

ive been to the hospital due to wanting to kill myself. i went in november after having 3 breakdowns in 3 days in a row. my mom made me feel bad about it, saying that going to the hospital with me was the worst day of her life. i want to go back so bad, but i dont want to trouble her again.

ive been abused several times. my parents use abuse tactics, and twice ive been emotionally abused. the first time was the worst. it happened in early 2015, and my abuser left me on march 14th. what he did to me (insults, not caring, etc) still haunts me to this day and i still get panicky every now and then.

on tumblr, a person made a callout post for me, saying i was gross and abusive towards that person i just mentioned. this person is almost a legal adult. and... that abuser got a HUGE say in the post. he provided screenshots of stuff from when i was literally 12 and unstable.

im worse than him.

and my friend's boyfriend added onto the post, saying i forced my abusive ex to do disgusting things. I DIDNT FORCE HIM. HE SAID HE'D DO ANYTHING HE WANTED FOR ME, AND WHEN I ASKED HIM TO DO SOMETHING HE SEEMED MORE THAN GLAD TO DO IT.

and then, that same friend's boyfriend almost CALLED THE POLICE ON ME because i saw him talking about how he hates me and i snapped and told my friend i hoped he died and my friend fucking told him even though thats personal.

my mom doesnt care about my mental health. i literally cannot stand school and homework. last week i skipped wednesday so i could do my homework, but i couldnt. i couldnt get motivated. i didnt have the energy.

when she confronted me later, i told her i didnt have the energy and she told me i shouldve taken my adderall.

i told her i wanted to die, and she literally said ""how about i slap your face and get it out of your system?""

she was on the phone with my aunt at the time. as i was going upstairs almost crying, she said to my aunt how she wanted to spank me and how she gives me everything yet all i do is give shit back.

i feel so damn unloved. everytime i have a crush on someone, its the worst thing in the world. worse yet, they never love me back. so it ends up with me breaking down a lot and not wanting to tell due to them probably leaving me because im creepy.

and everytime i DO get in a relationship with someone, i end up not having any romantic feelings whatsoever.

and everytime i do get in a relationship, that person is SO far away. you see i live in a tiny town with only 800 people, who of which are... awful. every kid here sucks, and they hate me because im weird as hell.

for once, i want to love someone who lives at most 50 miles away from me. my mom would never let me meet people because shes selfish. everytime i tell her about what we could do, how we could get there, she shuts me down due to ""too much money"". i actually had a breakdown on christmas due to not being able to meet someone.

i dont know if its my body or my meds have stopped working. i used to take 10 mgs of adderall, and it worked. but i recently took 25 mgs of adderall recently, and i STILL felt tired.

and finally, im 99% positive something bad happened to my best friend, who i need to function.

What a waste of time, assuming there is no relevant difference between a medical abstract and a psychiatrist's report for my purposes.

I have ADHD and BPD. I was diagnosed with ADHD years ago and then BPD recently.

I asked my [kind-of-local doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48t0vz/is_it_offensive_to_request_my_doctors_to_write_a/) who diagnosed me to write me a diagnosis report for BPD, like the one I had for my ADHD, which I showed her. If I recall right, she asked me why, and then I told her I might give it to a future doctor of mine. I asked her how much. She told me the price.

Later on, in the context of the link I said above, she told me that she won't give me a report unless a doctor of mine requests. Since it's not a med certificate, the report must be addressed to someone rather than something like ""to whom it may concern""

She seems offended by the things I am asking her. I'm worried my medications or illnesses might cause me to say something stupid offensive or sound like bullying.

Please advise me. What are the mechanics of writing, getting and using a diagnosis report? What am I allowed to ask? can my psychiatrist restrict access to those who would see the report? I mean she's the one with the confidentiality obligation. How does a client have an obligation of confidentiality?

I got a diagnosis report for ADHD. Why not BPD?

I was running low and couldn't afford the Pristiq out of pocket so my doctor allowed me to change to Venlafaxine ER which is $40. With it came a 20 day ""crossover titration"" plan. I only had 1 Pristiq pill left before I was able to get the venlafaxine though, so today I'm having to go straight into the full venlafaxine dose with no taper.

I can't afford private insurance out of pocket- the lowest cost, shittiest plan I could find that even met some of the requirements I needed was over $200 and does not cover office visits, deductible is $6000 which might as well be a million dollars to me right now.
I've been waiting since December for Medicaid approval (it's supposed to take 30 days) and when I checked in with them last week they said they were so backed up it could take over 90 days before I hear back (approved or not). I went to the local free clinic and they told me the wait time to see a general doctor is 4-6 weeks if I'm approved, and months long for a psychiatrist with no guarantee of actually seeing one. 

Today after jumping to venlafaxine I started sweating and my stomach is upset and I feel nauseous. I'm worried I'm going to have bad withdrawal and brain zaps. I've been told by another person that the only way to get help is to go to a county ER and say you're suicidal (even if I'm not). I'd be committed (and according to their story it is a terrifying experience- I very much do NOT want this! I'd rather die) BUT it's the only way I'd be able to be treated without insurance. I feel so hopeless and sick and scared. There's no safety net. Being stuck without help is actually making me feel it would be easier if I just gave up and died. I can't go through weeks of bad withdrawal again. The meds aren't really all that effective and I would like to be in therapy, but... I can't. 

Is there ANYTHING that anyone has been able to do or take that helped them with an abrupt medication transition/withdrawal? ",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Switching from Pristiq to Effexor, no crossover. Anyone experienced this? I am running out of options."

I am a male who was born 22 years ago. I am a single child and there is a 2 generations gap between my parents and me. This might seem pointless but you'll understand later. They were already struggling with health issues. As a child I had trouble reaching for their attention because of this. I had no one to play with and a hard time understanding what a sane relationship was because their suffering made them avoid me, as I was asking a lot of energy from them. 

That distance made it really hard to me to make friends in school. Though, I had one friend, the neighbor's kid. We saw each other everyday and I think that saved my social life. But as we got into school he had no problems making new friends. And since I was awkward and weird the other kids did not want to see me. We saw each other only when there was no other kid around. He told me several times that I had to leave when his other friends were coming over. I was also bullied a bit, but not too much. Other kids were telling me I was ugly, but I was kind so other kids did not completely reject me. 

My parents separated when I was 9. I used to live with both of them, one week each. But my mother had the biggest health and mental issues so she was very abusive to me. Her whole family did not want to talk to her anymore. She didn't have any friends. She used to unleash all her problems on me in a manner that made me the cause of them all. I don't think she realizes it even today. I didn't understand what I did. I was being yelled on for everything. This made me cry. A lot. And when I cried my mother often told me things along these lines: ""See, you're crying, that means I am meaningful to you and that you love me. Why do you keep making me mad then?"". It made me very sad. My mother's health got worse and I've had to choose (actually she just couldn't take care of me at this point) to go live with my father. She knew my ""choice"" wasn't really one but she blamed me for it. This made me believe I was a very bad person since I was so mean to my mother in so many ways. She was so sick she had to quit her work. This was around 11 years old. 

At the same time, on the other side, my father was still attached to my mother and still loved her. He did everything for her, paying her rent but also cellphones, groceries, etc. He took his retirement. He listened to her every single day until I was 20 years old. She called and came by the house multiple times a day. She was very displeasing. I felt responsible of her too. From this time and on, my father was highly unhappy. He stopped showing me any sings of live. He was exhausted from taking care of my mother. Stressed from all the money he didn't have but had to spend for the both of us. He just didn't care anymore. He took everything on him even through his own health issues. He abandoned every of his projects. That made him a very pitiful human being. He was not mean. He was providing, that's all. We never talked. I still have no idea who that man his. I refrained from sharing my problems with him because he has already enough on his back and he never reached out to comfort me when I feel bad. 

Just after that I turned 12 and started high school. This marks the beginning of the depressive era of my life. As I have stated, making friends was really hard for me. I couldn't connect with all the new kids I met. I was rejected constantly. I started having really intense sadness feeling. I remember being in class and faking a suicide with a gun all the time. I was highly unhappy. I started eating less, losing weight, almost being anorexic. I started sleeping less because I was too anxious about life. I didn't know what to do with my life. I had no motivation to do anything. I thought about suicide a lot. 

I made some friends online and started listening to music a lot more. I liked metal. I found people I connected with through that, but they lived too far for me to see them. They were emos and I read a bit on the subject on the internet. I thought it fitted me perfectly. I wanted to show I was relating to this, so I became emo myself during the summer. The year after this I came back and it started going downhill. I didn't realize i'd get bullied a lot from being emo, but I that's what I related to. It was who I was. I was hanging out with my neighbor one day at school and people bullied me and him. He told me it annoyed him and that he didn't want my choice to ruin his reputation because he would lose all his friends. I understood. 

I was now truly alone. I was hanging out with the other rejects that I didn't like because they were the only ones that would understand me. But we didn't really had any common interests except not being intimidated. It was just easier for us to defend in a pack than alone. I was constantly being bullied. Nobody knew me or talked to me, yet people called me names, said mean things to me, told me I should kill myself (and as I was already suicidal it made me want to do it even more). Strangers in the streets did it too. My father didn't approve me, he called me a faggot (I am straight). People threatened to beat me up. Teenagers I didn't know beat me up on halloween for no reason except my looks. Some teenagers I knew from primary school waited before my house every single day just to threaten me and insult me. One of them died in a car accident and the other didn't bother me after. When I learned it I laughed because it was a relief to me. But I felt like a monster, he didn't deserve death, and people around him suffered. First my mother, then this kid, what the f**k kind of psychopath was I? 

I met my first girlfriend when one of the rejects asked me to do something during the weekend. She went to another school and was popular. She is the first person that truly knew me. She was the first person to fully accept me and love me. I lost my virginity to her. But she treated me in a way that made me feel unloved. I.e. I came to her apartment to watch her play videogames, she didn't care it bore me or that I wanted to play with her. It was not really suffering, but it did bother me. I felt like it was all about her and nothing about me. One of her friends told me she was cheating on me because she was mad at her,  but I didn't know. She also left me for a week because she tried to get with my friend (let's call him Bob, this is important for later), who denied her. One day, as I was feeling less and less like I should be with her, she came to me and told me she feared she was pregnant because she was late. I felt stuck with her. I left as soon as she told me she got her period. Later on I was thinking she manipulated me, so I was really mad at her, but she didn't know. 

I was feeling lonely so I went on to find a new girlfriend, since that was the only thing that calmed my suicidal urges. I was not sure I loved her but she was beautiful. We had fun together. I rapidly found out I really loved her and we ended up spending 3 years together. By the way, both of those girlfriends knew my mother and were pushing me to stop having contacts with my mother, and I agreed with them. I just didn't know how, and I felt bad because that would have made her suffer even more. So I kept seeing my mother on the weekend despite that made me very stressed and sad. Anyway, back to the second girlfriend. She was depressed too. She was mutilating a lot, she slit her wrist during class. I tried to help her but I was unable to be enough for her needs. I didn't know what to do so I slit my wrist when she did because I felt responsible for her and I wanted to show her that it hurt me she hurt herself. Since I felt abused from my first girlfriend and I didn't want to be in that position again, I was very abusive myself to her. Since I was always alone I had a lot of thoughts to share. In fact I was thinking all the time to make sense out of all my suffering. This made me good at arguing so I always put the situation to my advantage. I also entered CÉGEP (a higher educational school before University here in Québec) around this time, in which we have to follow philosophy classes. It fascinated me. I was a philosopher. All these years I had been doing philosophy on my own and I didn't even know. That's what I liked: making sense. My life was not about being happy, I thought this to be impossible. My goal was to create meaning through suffering. At the time Plato was my favorite philosopher. I was a rationalist, elitist, idealist out of this world, in an utopia where I could escape so there was no suffering. This made me a real asshole to my girlfriend of the time. To me, there was absolute Truth. I could defend my opinions and she didn't so I had to be right: my opinion was ""objectively better"" than hers. And she agreed with me most of the time. She must have felt so bad thinking she was always wrong, it still makes me sad for her. We stayed together until I entered University in Philosophy. I left her because I thought she was too superficial, unable to ground herself into reason. 

But I still loved her but I thought I could only achieve my true intellectual potential by being with a more philosophical girl. I was suffering deeply. I woke up everyday just to cry until I fell asleep. This and reading Hume made me realize I was wrong to hide into reason instead of trying to actually feel better, but I didn't want to admit it to myself. I was biased by emotions. I could always forget it and act accordingly to reason. 

I found a new job at the time, which I still have. It is there that I found my self-esteem. there I could really be myself. I really am different on the outside and on the inside. Outside I am this very smily guys who looks like he loves life. They recognize my weirdness and praise me for it. I can act weirdly, extravagantly and people accept me. They love me and respect me. They think I am funny, they admire me, they want me to be a part of their life. It felt good. I didn't feel like I had to be with a girl to calm my angst against life.  Still, there, I met another girl, lets call her Molly. She was exactly like me. Suicidal, depressed, rational. She was the girl I had wished to meet. The idea of her was ""perfect"". I didn't have a strong feeling of love for her, I didn't think she was beautiful. But her mind was perfect. I had platonic love for her. I thought I was ready to have a sane relationship. We saw ourselves a lot. She was really special, just like me: crazy outside, depressed inside. She loved philosophy and was critical. But also, (disclaimer: this is probably where the shit hits the roof, until today) she was really, really weird. But it need a better context. At the time I was working two jobs and had taken more classes than average in university. Also, at this point I cannot go sleep to my mother's apartment since her health had gotten worse and she needed surgery. But as you know already, she had no one. But she needed somebody to take care of her. And you now know how my father was with her. So you've probably guessed she came to live at my father's house. It was unbearable. Anyway, back to Molly, I had made some friends during all of this and I when they met her they told me that something was wrong with her. I agreed, because something was wrong with me. I didn't think it was a problem. She was suicidal, as I was. One day, she felt really bad and told me to come to her house. Her friend (lets call her Catherine) also came knocking on her bedroom window because she was worried about her, but I was with her so Molly told her she was ok and Catherine left. Also she didn't see her dad much because, just like my mother, he had been abusive in her childhood. I never knew how though. Someday we started acting towards being boyfriend/girlfriend. But she was doing everything very weirdly. She kissed me and then denied any other kiss from me. She made physical contact but avoided me immediately after. I asked her what was up. She didn't want to tell me. One day she opened up and she told me she had been raped by another teenager when she was younger. At a party they threatened her with a knife and a girl got down on her without her consent, before them getting on her. I was supportive to her and respected her limits. We kept seeing each other. I went to her house and we talked all night long. But weird things kept happening. Her phone would ring in the middle of the night. Not once, it rang like 30 times in a row. She received multiple texts too. She finally told me it was her ex that was harassing her. He had raped her too, multiple times and she was trying to get him out of her life but he kept coming back. I told her we should file a report to the police. She did not want. I didn't know what to do. Once, we were working together and she waited for me after her shift. She told me her ex was in the shop and that she wanted me to go take a coffee with her after my shift so we could escape him. We went to a coffee shop and talked there for a while. She was really stressed out. She kept turing around to see if he was coming in. I ended up telling her to come sleep by my house, but she refused. I didn't want to look like a rapist or force her, so I agreed when she told me she wanted to go back to her home. When I arrived there, there was a car parked with the lights opened. I asked her if it was her ex. She told me yes. I told her to come with me. She refused. I didn't know what to do. I wanted to kill that guy. Desperate for help, I went back home. We kept seeing each other. I was trying to help her the best I could. As time went on I learned she was bulimic. She left school to treat herself. Her health was deficient. She also had had a surgery and needed to take hormones supplement to regulate her mood. Another day while we were together I was receiving phone calls on my cellphone. I would pick it up and there was nobody talking on the other hand. I received phone call after phone call. One day I was at my second job and received a phone call. Same thing, but this time I was alone. I provoked the person to talk. This is the first time I heard a voice on the other end. It was a girl. She asked me if I was Molly's boyfriend. I told her it was unclear, and asked why she wanted to know. She answered that it was because she was Molly's girlfriend and she was scared because she told her stories about a guy that was raping him. She thought I was that guy, as I thought she was the ex boyfriend. ""She"" was actually Molly's friend that went to her window, Catherine. We talked for a while and understood that Molly had invented everything, except one of the rapes that actually happened but with someone else. Catherine and Molly had been together for a few years and Catherine was thinking about leaving her. Molly couldn't handle herself alone so she was using me as a backup plan. When her relation was about to crash, she went to me. When her relation was doing good, she rejected me. We went to get her help and they told us we had to face her together. We woke up early before school and went to her. We told her we knew everything. She had a breakdown. Her mother told us she would stay with her so we left to go to school. Later in the day during class I receive a phone call telling me Molly had tried to kill herself and she wants to see me. I go to the hospital and she tells me she's going to be followed by a psychiatrist. I feel reassured. So I stay around to support her and try to keep my distances. Long story short, I finally understand that she keeps lying to her psychiatrist so he basically knows nothing about her. My friend suggests me she might have borderline personality disorder and it fits her perfectly. Plus, since she was bulimic, the hormones she had to take were spit out immediately when she was throwing up so they didn't do their job, explaining the depressive state. So I decide to go talk to him and he tells me he wants to know nothing because he can't trust a stranger and that it is not accepted by his deontology code. So I read a bit and find out I can write an anonymous letter to him, which I do. I slowly get away from her. We see each other less and less. Catherine ends up telling she was diagnosed with bordeline personality disorder. 

With everything that's happening, the two jobs, school, my mom, Molly, i'm just traumatised. And while all of this is happening my mother is still home with us. She was way invading every inch of my personal life. She was always shouting at me for random stuff. I couldn't take it anymore. One day we were eating and she was impossible to deal with. I was sick of it so I got up and told them I couldn't eat. She was pissed that I left table so she got up and grabbed my arm. I yelled like I never have: ""Back off, I cannot take it anymore! Leave me alone!"" and forced my arm out of grasp to go in my room. I heard her shouting at me and coming to me. I felt aggressive and did not want it to turn violent. So I panicked and picked up the first thing I was, that was a swiss knife. I threatened her with it so she'd understand she had to leave. She got scared and went away. This is the last time I talked to her, I never wanted her to regain contact with me again, despite her trying. I feel bad because I know this made her suffer a lot. I never wanted to talk to her again because the relation was toxic to begin with. It's better off that way for the both of us I think. 

Anyway. At this point of my life I discover Nietzsche and it blows my mind. I completely turn my way of thinking around. I feel better with myself. Still depressive, but better. I step over the absolutist, idealist that I was. I notice that my way of thinking has made me unhappy with the girls I've been. And a bit after that, I meet another girl and this one plays off well. But (of course it cannot be simple) she was leaving the country because of school. During this relationship, something fucked up happened again. I was coming back from school as usual around 2 PM. I try to put my key in the door but it's already opened a bit. I'm freaking out, who's in? Why isn't the alarm going off? I walk in. A lady's there in her pyjamas. Never seen her in my whole life. She's getting drunk in the kitchen while smoking cigarettes inside the house. What the actual fuck? She proceeds to tell me she's an old employee of my father. But nobody told me she was coming so i'm in shock. I gotta go to my second job so I leave her there. My father finally calls me to tell me what's up. Her husband is dying from cancer and she can't live in her house anymore so we're gonna have her here for a few weeks. She's fucked up. She's an alcoholic. She smokes. She's highly depressed. Her husband dies and her mother dies too like a week later. She's coming to me everyday to cry in my arms because my father has found a job and is never home. I was almost done with my bachelor's degree at the moment so I didn't have much school and was home a lot. I feel bad for telling her that her smoking in the house is not ok for me but end up doing it anyway. Well, as soon as her husband dies, she starts trying to seduce my father. He tells me he doesn't want to be with her, that it's probably just a way for her to cope. I agree. Months go by. She's still there. I ask my father what's happening between them and he tells me that there's nothing. But they cuddle a lot. So i'm just putting the pieces together. I feel bad for my father because he's alone and manipulated. Her power on him keeps growing. He doesn't tell her to go out to smoke anymore. He buys her her alcohol, cigarettes, feed her. But she's just a gold digger. Concerning my girlfriend, we tried to keep it going but it was just not the same when she came back so broke up. Also it turns out she wanted to fuck one of my friends while we were dating. Great. 

I then meet my last girlfriend. She is literally perfect. She has everything: Looks. Talent. Brains. Funny. Simplicity. Never had so much fun with a girl in all my life. At this point it's the first time in my life since i'm 12 I do not want to kill myself. I still have depression symptoms, but I don't feel the urge to disappear. We go out a lot. We laugh all night long. We have great sex. We do art together. We talk about deep stuff. 

One night she comes to me and tells me she needs help. She is bulimic and wants to quit. I tell her i'll be there for her but I cannot do everything for her like I already did before with Molly. Some days after i'm dicking around on her computer and find a folder that she does not want me to open. I ask her what it is and finally discover that she has been camwhoring on 4chan before. I feel unconfortable with this because I don't want to think of my girlfriend as a whore, especially that I know what she's worth. She tells me she didn't post during us but I feel something's wrong in how who talks. I don't make much of it. The night after we go to the bar and she has a total breakdown on the way home. She says her life sucks, and cries a lot. She's in total pannick. We go to her room and I cannot do anything to make her feel better. She wants to throw up but can't because she thinks it's bulimic and wants to quit. At this point I fear for her. She's crying so hard that her parents come to see what's happening. Her mother thinks i'm responsible and I tell her that we should go to the hospital because she really isn't feeling well. She doesn't want to (note that it's free in Canada!!!). She says she's been a bartender and never seen anyone get problem from drinking too much. I feel exasperated. Her mom doesn't know she's bulimic so I have to oppose her and tell her everything. They decide to go. They kept her for the night and I watched her. I watched over her all night long. The next day I went with her to her meetings with the physicians and she took very good decisions about her problems. 

Finally back home I struggle with that 4chan thing and decide to check the archives. I find her posts, which are very intense in both what she says and what she does. I also find out that she has lied to me and that she had posted during us. I feel betrayed. I confront her the next day. She tells me it was not new stuff and that she did it because she was in a bulimic episode and wanted to feel good about her body. I feel bad, but I go check and it checks out in what she says in her posts. But I also find out new content that she has made during us. I feel absolutely destroyed. Who is she really? What do I mean to her? How could she tell other guys what she tells me during sex? She says it's still from bulimia and didn't think what she said. I want her to tell me everything, because she lied to me so much I don't feel like I can trust her anymore. She tells me she's talked on 4chan about having a one night with a guy just before we met but it was a lie. But I quickly find out it's not a lie. I am pissed off. She lied to me again. Still I feel a strong connection to her. And she doesn't want to lose me either. 

We agree to make a ""blood promise"". She would crave a symbol in her skin with a blade as a gage of her trustworthiness. One night she comes to my house and we both know how crazy this is. She does it. I feel fucked up for this. At this point I acknowledge this is not normal. I decide it's time to finally act and call the psychology center from my University. I have went over what is acceptable. 

But there is a waiting list so I can't see anyone. I have no idea how to deal with the trust issues i've started to develop. One night we are at a party in a bar and I am really mad at her for lying to me. I leave to take a drink and when I come back a guy's trying to seduce her. I come and talk to them and he leaves without me saying anything. Someone calls me in the distance so I go over to him. When I come back she's not in the bar anymore. Nor is that other guy. I pannick. I go outside looking for her and I can't find her either. She's been gone for like 45 minutes. I finally find her and ask here where she had been. The trust issues kick in and I accuse her of having fucked with that guy in the bathrooms. It's not that I think she's a whore, it's that what i've seen of her past makes me anxious and I have no idea how to deal. She's legitimately pissed. 

We keep seeing each other still. The same week we are drinking at a friend's house and one of my friend, Bob from the begining, tells him he can give her a nice massage. Despite my trust issues, she accepts, everything's fine for her (and it is). But i'm sitting there and i'm boiling. I finally decide to just quit cause I don't want to get mad at her because I know it's because of my first girlfriend that I am so pissed. Another friend comes out to talk to me. She tells me we should talk. I agree. She goes back in and my girlfriend comes out. She's crying. She knows i'm mad. She knows I will accuse her and isn't ready to deal with it. I start blaming her and I can tell she can't do this. I try to tell her how I feel, because of the past story with Bob, without hurting her but it still does. She can't take it anymore so she turns around to go back inside. I take her arm to turn her around so we can talk some more but as I do I feel the anger coming up, so the gesture turns out a lot more intense than I intended and I throw her in the snow. She gets up and shouts for help because she is scared of what I will do to her. I immediately realize I overreacted. I never meant to be violent to her but I still was. My friends come out and make her go in. I want to apologize to her because this never happened to me. I don't understand what happened. I'm just wondering what the fuck have I done. I'm drunk and I regret everything. 

There I cry in the snow for a good hour. I plan on attempting suicide the next morning. My friend walks me back home. I delete my facebook account. I make my goodbyes to my girlfriend and tell her I am incredibly sorry. I go to sleep. I wake up the next morning to my friends waiting for me in my house. Bob is there because he knows I desperately need help. He opens up his arms and hugs me. I cry like never before. He asks me if I want help. I say yes. He brings me to the hospital and wait for hours. There I talk to some people and they say they're going to call me back for me to see a psychiatrist. During that time i'm dealing with trying to convince my girlfriend i'm not a woman beater. I also keep working two jobs and am starting my masters degree. So when they call me back i'm not home. I want to call back but I can barely even find time to call during the office hours. And when I finally get to call, it's either lunch or they do not answer. So 2 weeks after I finally reach someone, but they have put my file to the archives. They tell me they'll call me back when they find it. So I wait a bit and they call back. Time runs again and they tell me they're not going to help me because since it's been too long they consider my case is not an emergency. I am broken. I was counting on this. It was my only hope. I feel highly suicidal. I've reached out everywhere I know and nothing works. 

This very week I get a call from the psychology center of the university. They had a place for me. My girlfriend was regaining trust in me because I did not keep blaming her and did never act violent with her ever again. Everything was on the way up. I'm working with my psychiatrist on my depression, as well as my trust issues that he says are link to an obsessive disorder. My girlfriend and I were just like in the beginning. We loved each other and had fun just like before. Everything finally seemed to get into order. She's trying to deal with her bulimia too, she's having a therapy. 

But sometimes she feels down because of her body and it affects us. She has low self esteem and takes criticism very harshly. In the last two weeks she's got pissed at me for very small and random stuff. I didn't make much of it because we had such a good time together. We were also thinking about going to live together. I also confronted my father and the lady because I thought I was leaving home. This has created another layer of insanity to the house atmosphere. But two days ago my ""girlfriend"" told me we were done. She just left. She says she loves me but can't afford being in a couple with me. She can't deal with herself and be with me at the same time. I understand her. We agreed to take a break just to get better with ourselves and that we would see then. But she is also not the kind of person who develops strong attachment. She doesn't really care to never see me again. This hurts the most. I am not ready to see her going around seducing other man. I feel completely destroyed. I feel like emptying my heart. As soon as my life seems to get in order, everything falls apart.

Maybe all teenagers go through that phase but it's not fun. It's scary. I noticed that the only thing I look forward to each week is seeing two people I really like... but even then one person is only twice a week and the other is at the end of the day 2-4 times a week.

So I realized that, what, I go through all this stuff every day just to get to the end of it to see someone I enjoy? For years? That's like eating an entire moldy sandwich just to get to the delicious end piece. What's the point of that? Is living just for the highlights worth it? I'm starting to think not. It's actually depressing.

I'm not even looking forward to graduating, or college, or being an adult. 

And I just feel like there's so many bad things. On the news it's overwhelming: climate change, ISIS, genocides, wars, inequality, shootings, bombings, people starving, people sick, debt, terrifying future presidential candidates, etc. Then on a local level people I know have cancer, a system I thought was strong is actually falling apart, people I thought had their shit together actually don't, those I looked up to are actually not that good of a role model.

On a personal level I can't get in to too much. But all the anxiety, losing people, pets, witnessing abuse, fighting, more cancer, etc. I just don't feel it's all worth it.

I never wanted to take medication because I was always so scared it would change me. I hated myself more than anything and yet at the same time I thought I was better than everyone else. Even if my brain and how I think was killing me, I still didn't want to take medication because I didn't want to become ""dumber"". Well the fact that I thought that shows how dumb I really was in the first place, if anything I feel a lot smarter when I get bursts of happiness. It's kind of like that episode of ""House"" if you've seen it. Where Wilson tells House that being miserable doesn't make him better than anyone else, it just makes him miserable. I felt like that, I wanted to be miserable for a combination of fucked up reasons. 

I have been on medication once before and it didn't work. All it did was gave me insomnia and my depression was just as bad. That was about a year ago and I didn't go back in because I was afraid what my psychiatrist would think of me. I just didn't want to keep changing meds and I was afraid nothing would work. I told myself I'd rather be miserable. Even when I started to realize I NEEDED help or I wouldn't be able to live, I STILL was too scared and would tell myself ""Well what if I keep getting medication and none work?"", ""What if my doctors just think I'm a little bitch and I need to help myself?"", ""What if it did make me happy but I became just like everyone else and would forget how ""real"" depressed me was?"". I refused to get help for stupid reasons, reasons that seemed completely normal and well thought out at the time. But now I see they weren't.

I never got help, and about a month ago I tried to commit suicide. It failed, obviously, and I ended up getting a lot of pain, spending time in the loony bin, and getting a big ass hospital bill. Even the psychiatrist that got assigned to me was a complete asshole. He ended up telling me I had a bad attitude and would get mad at me if I tried to explain what I thought might help me. He ended up prescribing me really bad medication that didn't fit the problems I had at all, and I didn't know any better. But then I got lucky and met a doctor shortly after that was amazing. She talked to me for less an hour, and I didn't even say much, but just from my mannerisms and the little she found out she pretty much described me spot on. She realized what the psychiatrist prescribed me wouldn't do much for me and she changed my medication.

Now I'm here. at first the medication didn't do much. I actually think it made me more depressed in the beginning. for a while I basically did nothing all day, had no energy, and only thought about suicide. I started smoking weed to just feel something, ANYTHING, but weed had very unpredictable results and sometimes I would feel great for a short time, but completely fucking terrible the next few hours. However something clicked in me yesterday. I smoked weed that day too so I'm really hoping that it wasn't that that did it. I'm hoping it was just a coincidence and that my medication is finally kicking in, because I feel good for once. I can feel my depression still there, but it isn't taking over my thoughts and driving me like it always did before - all day every single day. I can focus now. When I was depressed and suicidal I was always thinking about the future, never living in the present. I was always thinking about what I'm going to have to do today, how it's going to suck, how everything is complete shit, and then it would make me not end up doing anything. Then I would just feel even shittier because I didn't do anything. It was a cycle of feeling like shit. Right now though I can think about something and I can do it and feel good about it. I'm able to study and actually focus, I feel like I have more energy, and my thoughts are not going crazy all the time. 

I'm hoping it was my medication, I'm hoping this is a regular thing for me now. I do not want to go back to how I was, I CAN'T. If you yourself are thinking about getting medication but haven't for certain reasons, please please please DO IT. Don't get to the point that I did. We all think ""Suicide is not the only option"" is the most bullshit, patronizing thing that people who don't know what it's like tell depressed people to try to comfort them. But I'm one of those miserable and depressed people too and I'm telling you it really isn't the only option.

I just feel like living isn't something that I was designed for. Anything the average person would enjoy, I'm just sort of like ""ehh, whatever."" The only thing that genuinely makes me happy is my girlfriend. But, I get depressed thinking about what I would do without her. Everything else in life just isn't interesting to me, and I feel as if I have no useful skills. I just feel like a waste, taking up empty space. I never want to get out of bed and actually do anything. Even things people would be jumping out of bed for. Almost every night, I cry myself to sleep in hopelessness that I am a lost cause. I think about what would happen if my girlfriend broke up with me, or if I was to lose someone in my life that means a lot to me. I let my negative feelings overpower anything that makes me happy.

I just thought I would take some time out to let you all know that I think I'm finally beating this social anxiety and that there's hope for each and everyone of you.

Around 2 months ago, I had a relatively severe depressive episode that resulted in me having to be sent home from work.  I looked at my life and it just felt so empty and pointless, I had a poor paying job, no friends and was too socially anxious to try and make friends with people because I was terrified of being judged and I felt like I didn't fit in with the rest of society, it honestly felt unbearable.

About a month ago I was persuaded by some of my work colleagues and members of my family to visit my doctor to try and get help for the problems that had been causing me so much pain and anguish over the years, and it was by far one of the best things I have ever done in my entire life.

I was prescribed an SSRI called Sertraline (I believe it's also known as Zoloft) mainly to treat the recurring depression I was suffering from and I'm happy to report that I haven't had another depressive episode since starting treatment and it has also rather unexpectedly made my social anxiety almost completely disappear.

I was out for a meal last Saturday with my dad, his girlfriend, my brother, my brothers girlfriend and my brothers girlfriend's friend, whom I had never met prior to that day and it went perfectly.

I was actually initiating conversations with everyone at the table and it just seemed to come almost naturally, for the first time in a long time I actually wasn't stuck in my own head and worrying about what other people thought about me.

Fast forward to today, I just received another prescription for the SSRI I am currently taking and on the way to my doctors office I was sitting next to some guy on the bus that I never knew and ended up speaking about programming and building websites and I just felt so at ease having a conversation with a stranger on a bus full of people that I don't know.

Sorry if this has been a long post, I just wanted to share my experience with everyone on this sub because I am so fucking proud of myself.

Keep fighting people, you will win in the end.

I live in an unfamiliar city in an unfamiliar state. I have no close friends, and really no friends that aren't hers. We still live together, we used to share our lives together. Now she's going out to clubs almost every night and coming home all hours. Other men are blowing up her phone. She's very desirable. I'm not. She has a waiting list of appointments with guys who are infinitely more successful, waiting to show her how much better than me they are. I lack any confidence I used to have. I spend my money on alcohol but don't want to drink it as it isn't working anymore. I drink it anyway.

I love her so much and tell her this every day. We often talk about suicide and depression - I've attempted in the past too. Despite this, she's always had a ""spark"" in her that made me think she will pull through and wouldn't kill herself - until recently.

Now though it's getting really serious. She's getting more hallucinations and voices, and has visibly felt REALLY down recently. It's culminated with her telling me she's been writing goodbye letters to everyone this week, and tomorrow will say her final goodbyes then kill herself on monday. I've never seen her this bad before, it's always been temporary. She's never actually written notes or said a date - just 'small' things like saying ""I want to kill myself in a few weeks"", and never for more than a few days at a time.

I told her that I'll always be there for her, like always, and that she is so important to me. She tried to change the subject and we ended up arguing when she started getting annoyed when she refused to talk about it (I told her if she's serious we have to talk about it). Later she apologised for ""putting [me] through all this"" and went to bed, and I said she's not putting me through anything compared to if she actually kills herself. Now I'm just sitting here, worried as fuck, with no good idea what to do next. I've told her to tell me anything on her mind, I told her to talk to anyone. I've tried being more aggressive/desperate, and tried being more accepting (which she says she knows is impossible). Nothing works - she just stays with his same fucking fixation on dying. There are a few fleeting moments where she seems ""back to normal"" and can laugh and shit again, but they're getting fewer and fewer.

We've always been super open and everything I've said in this post I've said to her before. I've literally sobbed holding her back and telling her not to suicide in the past, and she's dragged me back from the edge befre - but now it's gotten worse than I've ever seen and it's almost like she stopped caring about anything but dying.

Ultimately, I have no idea how I'll cope without her. I've been suicidal many times before and she is pretty much the last hope I had in life. It's not healthy but it's how it is - we are both stage 5 clingy with each other and people comment on us being inseperable. We made plans for the next few years only a month ago. She's just the best girl I've ever met and the love of my life and I can't bear losing her, and she knows this but lately it seems like she doesn't care about anything but dying, like she's dead set on it. Nonetheless losing her on monday will be fucking brutal and such a waste because she's such an amazing person even if she doesn't see it in herself.

Is there anything I can do? I told her I would literally do anything at all for her rn and she just said she ""doesn't want anything"". Anyone gone through similar things? Any insight at all would be really appreciated. Thank you in advance.

I am ashamed of my inability to help myself. I feel as if I am acting like I want to get better in front of my GP/family sometimes, and the other times it's just because it's 'practical'.

I have no concept of what it is to take joy in doing things. All I can do is sit on my ass, imagine myself in the situations normal people find 'fun' and wonder where the fuck motivation comes from.

In my model of the world and those around me, I understand that humans are creatures of habit and while we are on auto-pilot it is a grand fucking illusion at all that people do anything but take the laziest course of action 98% of the time.

My auto-pilot is myself wasting away. I have no habit or feedback loop to try and move up. I have no 2% that wants to take a grand fucking step and change anything.

The only thing I can say I'm proud of from the last whole *fucking* year is having lost 20 pounds in 20 weeks. Huge deal huh, I was overweight now I'm not. One second of my life I realized I was eating too much and shifted the coping mechanism from eating to feel better to feeling bad if I ate too much. Also, it's easy to *not* eat, good fucking luck getting me to improve my physical health in any other way. I probably walk more a single day of my going to class than this whole fucking spring break so far where I do nothing but reddit and other stupid online shit all day all week.

Great deal though huh? The *only* example of my doing anything but wasting away with the *illusion* of trying to work toward my degree was finding a unique way to punish myself.

I used to cut myself, a lot. That was a year ago and I have faded scars to remember it. Times when I would fume with self-hatred melted away by seeing blood run down my leg in the shower. I'm not happy that I feel like it helps me, but it doesn't frustrate me that I have the feelings. It doesn't frustrate me that I can't deal with this self-hate in any other way. It's frustrating to have this self-hate and not believe that can go away.

I look back on the short window between my previous two major depressive episodes (+ I've been dysthymic for years) and wonder I explained away all my mistakes: I can't be forgiven.

I am asking in preparation for my second exam in April 2016.**

&amp;nbsp;

I just spoke to my [kind-of-local doctor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48t0vz/is_it_offensive_to_request_my_doctors_to_write_a/) who said she is willing to write me a [medical abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/48yahq/is_it_offensive_or_uncommon_to_ask_my_doctor_who/) containing my medical history, treatment, diagnosis for BPD, why I was diagnosed with BPD, a description of BPD and ADHD including what its sufferers deal with, my difficulties with ADHD including my difficulties during exams.*

&amp;nbsp;

However, **she doesn't want to include a recommendation or a request for certain accommodations** (It's a cultural thing. No university in my third world country has a page on ADHD unlike, for example, Harvard, as seen in the link above). She said something like she is afraid of being held liable, but she agreed to talk to my professors in my university if they try to contact her.

Her text (paraphrased):

&gt;I was thinking hard about it, but then I might be liable since I haven't tried that, I don't really know how to do it, and in [name of her university], there are no guidelines for accommodations of mentally ill students.

&amp;nbsp;

Is it uncommon for doctors or psychologists to write these kinds of things? Is it offensive if I ask doctors or psychologists to write these kinds of things?

How is it in the US? In the UK? In the first world? Outside the first world?

&amp;nbsp;

**It just came to mind**: Last year, I was in my other country of residence (a first world country) while working on a project for a class. I had just started ADHD meds a few days prior. I had an argument with my dad and then I kept breathing deeply.

My parents, brother and I went to a clinic where a GP checked my blood pressure and prescribed me sleeping meds. My mom asked the GP if he could write me a note requesting to extend the deadline for the project (I never used the note and got an extension anyway), and the GP said ""Happily."" [Then again, that was related to a physical illness problem \(deep breathing, sleep difficulties, medicine side effects\) and not just a mental illness problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48t0vz/is_it_offensive_to_request_my_doctors_to_write_a/d0n9abs)

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

*I initially requested for two documents: first, a diagnosis report for BPD, and then later for a doctor's note requesting for accommodations on my behalf explaining my difficulties during exams. For the former, she didn't seem to have any problems and then just told me the price of the report. For the latter, she told me she had problems doing that but would state the accommodations used in other universities.

Later she had problems with both. For the former, she wouldn't give unless a doctor requested. For the latter, she had problems stating as well. She decided to just give me one doctor's note combining the two. There was a lot of confusion but eventually she ended up being too late to give me any notes or even a medical certificate in time for the exam. I just used my notes from my other doctors.

I was recently diagnosed with BPD after being hospitalized for a botched suicide attempt (I failed, dammit). I am so grateful to have found this place of support. Admittedly, it's relieving to have a name for my crazy, but it's been overwhelming and emotional to try and find out more about the disorder and consequently, myself.   On top of that, I've been abandoned by a friend recently, and now I'm constantly worried about all my other friends leaving me as well. It keeps me up at night. It's exhausting. Times have been rough to say the least. I'm sure you understand what I'm trying to get across.

Now back to my original question: I have been feeling not myself for the past four or five days. It's like I have no emotion at all, when normally I'm an emotional wreck and in so much pain. I'm still in pain inside, but it's as if someone has stuffed it into a black airless sack. At some point it's going to come back out, but in the meantime I feel like an empty shell going through the motions of life. 
I've disassociated before (many, many times), but it usually only lasts no more than one or two days. It doesn't help that since my suicide attempt, my spouse has been switched to day shift, so now he's home at night. That basically translates to ""I have no alone time to let myself break down,"" and it's slowly suffocating me from the inside.

I just turned 20 a couple of weeks ago. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14 and I have been battling with it ever since. It was only recently that I was put on antidepressants (first citalopram but I had awful side effects, and now on fluoxetine which seems to be doing okay) after it was concluded I had both severe depression and severe anxiety. 

I really have no idea what I'm doing. I've been unemployed for a couple of months now after I had to leave my job because it was killing me mentally. I went on to do temporary work as a deputy stage manager in December for a couple of weeks, but it was full on and I was exhausted which worsened my depression and I got sick and missed a day, meaning I lost the job completely. I sacrificed so much for this position and in the end I had it all thrown back in my face with no pay. 

I've been job hunting with no success. I've had interviews for jobs which I didn't get or just didn't hear back at all. I did have an interview at my nearest hospital for a housekeeping job which I was offered a contract for, but it's taking so long for everything to go through as I have to get a CRB check done too.

I left college after my first year with two AS levels both graded D as that's probably when my depression was at my worst. I don't want to go into detail but I was in a really bad place. I didn't go to university because I became afraid of education after how I felt after school and college, but I did end up on a live events course the January after which I enjoyed. 

Here is the thing: I love comedy, particularly stand-up. I want to work in that industry but I'm not entirely sure how to do it. I've done a lot of volunteer work - front of house (ripping tickets, ushering etc.) for about a year and a half and last summer I worked Edinburgh Fringe as a box office operator for one of the big four venues which I loved. It was the most exhausting thing I've ever done: working 8 hours a day every single day for 5 weeks, but I loved the people - the other staff, the performers, the customers. Being in that environment everyday for weeks was incredible and there's nothing like it. 

I think I'm just at a loss with what to do with myself. Because I don't have a job and haven't been getting a lot of luck with it it's beginning to bring me down after 3 months. I just want to get out there and work and go and see comedy shows and travel and move into my own place again.

I miss living on my own so much. Last year I had my own little flat for 6 months and it was heaven. I was happy, but most importantly, I was free. Now I'm living back at home and I feel like that's been snatched away from me. I can't help but think it might be living at home that could be bringing me down? I am always so happy when I am elsewhere, be it London, Edinburgh, Glasgow... Just anywhere away from this city. My independence is my priority, but I don't have it living here. But I can't get out until I get a job which I seemingly can't get right now. 

Things have been particularly tough recently. Just over two weeks ago, I was attacked when I was walking home. I was thrown to ground and held at knifepoint while I struggled and screamed like my life depended on it. ""Give him the bag or he'll stab you."" rolls around in my head more often than what I'd like. I'm fine, I wasn't hurt and nothing was taken, but my doctor now suspects I have PTSD after what happened and I've been struggling to cope and I don't want to outside. I'm too scared to. The times that I have been out after the attack has either begun or ended in a panic attack and I'm just so exhausted

There's a comedian I've been following for over three years who I keep turning to when I'm really low. We've met a bunch and we talk over social media and truthfully, sometimes he is the only thing that keeps me going

Trash covered the kitchen floor from when his out of control cat knocked it over. Everything was disgusting. Mold even grew on the floor. Of course he can drive so all he did was just escape it by going over to friends and telling them how horrible I am like he always does, but he had to come home eventually.

Please know that I'm not going to a therapist for solely this reason, I understand that a therapist is not a dating counselor. Before my girlfriend, I've never felt happiness before. I was depressed for a number of years, and after my depression stage, I wasn't happy either. I just kind of got by out of the obligation of living. I thought and still think about killing myself, but I have people in my life, and it would be unfair to them. Then I met a girl I thought was the one. I saw us together for a long time, but suddenly she ended the relationship because she just couldn't be with anyone right now. She says none of it is my fault, and it's all her, but I still feel like I could have changed something to let us last. After she left me, my depression immediately came back. And it wasn't like before, but it hit me all at once, adding on to my further pain of my girlfriend leaving me. My anxiety attacks came back, I constantly get mental breakdowns from thinking about her, and all I feel is loneliness, and I just wish I could end it all right now. I feel insignificant, and wandering in the world. I have a family that cares for me, but they don't understand what I'm feeling a lot of the time, so they end up getting stern and annoyed. I have a few people to talk to, but it isn't enough. I really need help. I have no reason to love myself. I realize how worthless my life is now that I don't have her anymore. I have no passion or ambition for anything. I have no hobbies, or anything that I enjoy, other than being with her. I just live. I usually just sleep a lot to escape the world, but I can't even do that anymore because all I do is dream about my girlfriend or wake up from nightmares in the middle of the night. I've been thinking of going to therapy, but I don't know if I'm qualified to. I don't want the therapist to think I'm here because of girl problems or anything like that. My girlfriend is a big cause of what I'm feeling, but not the only one. A lot of what I feel is also from past insecurities, and honestly, sometimes I don't even know what I'm sad about. I just am. I've been trying to pick myself up, I started cooking this week, but it just distracts me for an hour or two. After that, it's back to real life. I'm not sure what to do now.

So I'm reaching out to you, reddit. Everywhere around me smokers smoke a cigarette to calm down, relax, take a break, with their coffee, and other relaxing moments. And most of them enjoy it.

Do they smoke because it has calming effects? Or is it because the withdrawal from nicotine gives adverse effects and getting a dose of nicotine brings them back to 'normal'? Or both? Or it depends?

I am NOT planning to start smoking. Don't worry.

I was considering an e-cig with very, very low nicotine cartridges. I imagine it would be a lot like smoking a hookah? (I've only smoked tobaccoless hookah).

Yes yes, it's addictive. Nicotine and smoking (e-cig or otherwise) is widely accepted as a bad thing to take up.  However, (this is the hear me out part), my depression affects me in ways that are infinitely more harmful. It's clinical, it's bad, it's treatment resistant. I'm already on addictive pharmaceuticals. So I'm entertaining the idea because if I take a step back and look at it with an unbiased mind, if nicotine has a few positive calming affects that actually outweigh the negative consequences, a low dose fruity e-cig might not be a terrible idea. 

Or, does it make depression worse in the long run? I have no way of knowing. (Dr. Google just screams 'smoking is bad!' At every turn. So I need real lifers to weigh in.)

Thanks reddit.

TLDR:  Very bad clinical depression. Meds don't work, endorphins don't work, nothing. Considering a low dose e-cigarette as a tool to take the edge off, instead of turning to more serious and harmful things like alcohol or high dose pharmaceuticals.

Recently, I've been hit with a bout of serious migraines, so I've been prescribed fioricet with codeine. 

Using this drug, I've never been happier. It was like a miracle. I popped two of these, my fear of being out in the world dissapeared completely. I took a drive down to the store, had a polite conversation with the cashier. I had conversations with family members in ways that I had never done before. I was forgetting that I had a social phobia, that I was inhibited in any sort of way at all. I felt normal, comfortable around people. I wanted to be around people. 

But of course, Fioricet is a barbiturate, and akin to taking an amphetamine. It's addictive and has the potential for abuse, so my provider refuses to prescribe it to me. 

On the SSRI alone, I don't feel as motivated to participate socially. It brings me to a baseline were I don't feel the physical effects of anxiety, nor do I have depressive thoughts, but I still have trepidation about putting myself out there. 

Is there an intermediate option between a barbiturate and an SSRI? Is a benzo worth mentioning to my provider?

It sounds like an awful thing to say but it really kind of shook me and i got off of meds (which honestly didn't seem to do anything other than kill my already poor appetite) and over the next three years i started hanging out with people and got into some hobbies (movie, game then music collecting). 

Here's the thing though, i was still really weird. I went through all of high school spending lunch in either the bathroom or the stairwell. I spend study hall at a table away from everyone else as per my request. Occasionally i would ditch classes to sit by myself too.

One of my therapists suggested i had social anxiety which i honestly don't think is the case. I will usually be the ""speaker"" in group assignments and i don't really have much trouble talking to people. 

Also, i never had another relationship outside of the one when i was 15. I had a chance to have sex with her (the girl of my dreams by the way) and i said no for some weird reason. For a 15 year old dude that just seems so off. I've had chances to get with girls over the years but i never let anything start. I actually got sick of waiting for myself to like someone and i've been lying about dating a fake girl for like 8 months now.

What all those mean for a **university student with ADHD** (like me) is that said student in any of those places would or should be granted a [""reasonable accommodation""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_accommodation) such as extra time or extended deadline if

1. the student requests for such accommodation (of course going through the process eg submitting the appropriate documents and so on)

2. an appropriate university authority declares the requested accommodation as ""reasonable""

&amp;nbsp;

#**But who exactly has the authority to declare such a requested accommodation ""reasonable""?**

&amp;nbsp;

I read [here](http://www.additudemag.com/q%26a/ask_the_learning_expert/1390.html) that

&gt; since your accommodation has been approved by the disabilities office, the teacher is obliged to honor it. If your professor fails to provide extra time on tests, report him or her to the disabilities office.

&amp;nbsp;

#The ***assumption*** seems to be:

&gt; A mentally ill student would appeal **to the disability office and not their professors** of his/her university to request accommodations.

&amp;nbsp;

This is what I have read elsewhere: [Psychiatry](https://np.reddit.com/r/Psychiatry/comments/4bby0g/granting_of_extra_time_to_university_students_is/d1edc41) [Academia](https://np.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/4bbzzj/granting_of_extra_time_to_university_students_is/d1aisce) [ADHD](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4b9zzu/extra_time_is_supposed_to_be_decided_by_a/d17o42u) [AskDocs](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4bbw86/granting_of_extra_time_to_university_students_is/d17q8g7) [AskAcademia](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/4bbx4o/granting_of_extra_time_to_university_students_is/d17xo64)

&amp;nbsp;

(However, I also read that a professor is allowed to try to prove ""[**undue hardship**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undue_hardship)"" to the disability office. So, professors **can make appeals** but **cannot judge**.)

**While it seems sensible to me for this** (students appealing to disability office) **to be the standard procedure** (rather than students appealing to professors)

&amp;nbsp;

#**where exactly** in any of the above documents can I find support for ***the assumption***?

&amp;nbsp;

I'm hoping some part of those documents will give some kind of elaboration like:

&gt; Universities and Colleges

&gt; 1. The disability office of a certain university or college shall be where the students request for accommodations.

&gt; 2. The request procedure shall generally consist of the following steps:

&gt; 2.1 ...

&amp;nbsp;

I have a feeling such things are **not explicit** in those documents because they **should be obvious or core features** of the parts of the document relevant for university students.

I'm from the UK. I’ll try to make this short, about a month ago I (24F) went on a night out with my best friend Jenna (24F) of fourteen years, and two of her friends Lucy (26F) and Brian (28M) who I’d heard of favorable before, but not met. The night was brilliant and we all had loads of fun. We were all drunk, Brian and Jenna in particular. But I was merry, but in control. They ended up staying at mine for the night as it got too late for them to get transport. We all fall asleep at about 4am.


**Trigger warning from here.**

*Talk of sexual assault/nightmares/violence.*


So I stir awake with my eyes closed as I feel something touching me. At first I think I’m having a dream, but them I start to panic as I realize I’m definitely not dreaming and whatever is happening is real. I am overcome with fear not knowing what to do. I open my eyes and see Brian on me... using his fingers inside me and his mouth on me down there.


I immediately lunge, seizing him by the neck and start strangling him and screaming to get him off me. I scream at Jen to wake up, meanwhile I’m slapping and kicking Brian who is on the floor. I put on a pair of shorts from my drawer as brian had took mine off, and Jenna is half asleep asking me wtf is going on. I’m terrified of what he’s going to do, if he’s going to lunge at me, I am completely in shock of wtf is happening. I scream at Jenna to ring the police but she’s so sleepy so I just call them myself and am hysterical. Long story short, he is arrested, and I go to get a rape kit done and talk to the police. It was a fucking horrifying and I never thought I’d be in this situation in my life (well who does?). 


Since this has happened I find myself absolutely furious on a daily basis. I just cannot contain my anger. I find it difficult being out in public, especially taking the bus or the train as if anyone shoves past me or accidentally touches me I have to restrain myself from punching them. He’s bald and whenever I see a bald man in public I see his face on their face. I feel like I’m constantly a beat away from losing my shit. I walk around with a fist all the time ready to punch someone, I am snappy to my friends and family, I am not working, I can’t cope with work. I worry I would get into a fight at work. When I’m alone I cry constantly.


I can’t sleep as I keep seeing his face. I keep having nightmares of the incident happening over and over again and I get him off me and punch him until his face is just a bloody mess and he is dead. I have vivid dreams of all the ways I would kill him. I daydream about him dying. I hate this. I wouldn’t kill him. I just hate a human now like I never knew was possible.


What I worry about is that before this I was such a trusting and nice person. I thought I could read people well, I guess I can't and that scares me terribly. Now I hate people. I am scared of what other 'normal' people could be like. I am such a peaceful person normally but now I just feel like 99% of people in the world are evil. I don’t trust anyone. I never thought I would wish someone was dead, It repulses me, but I can’t help feeling this way.


If I’d thought there was even a hint of him liking me or Jenna I wouldn’t have let him come over as it’d be inappropriate, let along let him stay over. I hardly talked to Brian. He seemed very quiet, very shy, very introverted, but normal!!! For fucks sake! Jenna has known him for four years at her workplace so she could vouch for him. Judging she’s my oldest friend I trusted her judgement. I spent hald the night talking about my boyfriend for christs sake. I don't get it. I dont get what went through his head that what he did was appropriate or I don't know. It's terrifying. I feel digusting and scared.


Now my case is being made so i'm just waiting for everything to be sorted out for the case. I hate being in limbo. 

I'm doing my first counselling session tomorrow. Which I am so scared about. I don't know how to talk about my anger as I've never felt like this before. Also i'll have to make some other issues into another post but Jenna has been so unsupportive as she feels awkward, it's making my life even worse, when I really need a friend. Who was meant to be my best friend. But that's for another post. I just really need a friend right now and I hope i can talk to all of you guys in here. I feel really angry and really lonely at the moment.

I was an annoying child unable to hold onto friends i drove people away with my annoying personality, i fully accept that it was my fault that i didnt have friends, but i felt lonely. I always had my dog though her name was Lady, and she was awesome she kept me going because i knew i had a friend of some kind to come home to after a shitty day at school, that and my friends on World of Warcraft, they were the only friends i really had. I was very suicidal threw out all of high school I was very unpopular I had no friends at all I literally went to school avoided kids at every opportunity to avoid bullying but the worst part is I was unpopular but I wasn't smart either it seems like most kids in my situation at least had good grades and a bright future to look forward to but I was dumb and unpopular, I kept going because I thought one day it might get better One of the worst things that was a major mistake was i got a dog of my own, her name was Ari she is a German Shepherd and i had her for 1 year, i got her well living with my mom, my mother sold her house and i had to find a new place to stay, i had a place with Ari for a while but i got layed off (as every decent job i have ever got) and i couldnt afford the place i was renting anymore, i ended up having to move back in with my mother, for the 4th or 5th time... and the town house my mother was renting didnt allow dogs, so i had to do the hardest thing of my life and give my dog away, it has been over 16 months since i gave her away and i still think about her everyday, she was the only real friend i had. I loved her and now i am more alone then ever. Sadly i have started to even lose those World of Warcraft friends, they grew up have families now, relationships and dont have time for silly video games anymore, so loneliness is deffinitly one of the major contributers to me being suicidal. I would say the biggest contributer to me wanting to die is the fact that i feel like i will never accomplish anything of note in my life, i have no self confidence to speak of what so ever, and i have always been horrible at any kind of academics, i cannot study or write tests, when i try to study i take in words for about 1-2 pages or 5-10 minutes and then it turns to a blur and i take in nothing. It took my 5 tries to pass my drivers test and people tell me ""thats great see you persisted and you did it!"" and thats great but anything important in life costs alot of money, i cant afford to take a university course and fail it 4 times hoping one of these times i will pass, basically the only thing i have going for me in life is i am not in crippling debt. I wish i could get out of my Mothers house, i know she is sick of me still being here, she talks all the time about how she should get a minute to herself and all that, and i agree i am pathetic to still be here i want out so bad but i am a fucking mess of a human being, i want this existence over i want it to fade to black because that seems so much better then being a sad faliure every day.",depression,t5_2qqqf,My name is Adam

 my housemates refused to live with me next year because I'm too unstable, and third year is important, and they don't want to have to worry about me! Which is nice. 

 I'm living with these people until June, and then come September I'm moving back into halls of accommodation. This is very embarrassing, and I am not sure how to tell people that the reason is because I'm too unpopular. 

 I've read stuff before about depression/MI making it seem like nobody likes you. But what about when nobody actually does like me? After a suicide attempt, my friend left me after half an hour of waiting in A&amp;E, because she wanted to phone her boyfriend. I am the last to know anything ever, and I miss out on so many plans because nobody tells me about them. I try so hard to be a functioning member of the house - I buy things for the house, I make people laugh, I am always willing to hang out with people - but even a girl who studies psychology (and maybe should be slightly more tolerant) refused to live with me next year. 
 
 This has always happened. Primary school, my friends became best friends and excluded me. Any attempt at making other friends was rebuffed as I was a loser nerd with glasses. Secondary school, I was picked on for years (this is when I started seriously self harming) and even in my friendship group, felt like nobody wanted me there at all. Sixth form was worse. 
 I thought at uni that I had finally made some friends who actually liked me. They seem to like everyone else, even people about whom they bitch all the bloody time! I dread to think what they say about me behind my back, haha. But nope, I am useless at friendships. It is making me want to drop out of uni all together.

In addition to the depression I have also been treated for anxiety and PTSD. I used to be on crazy amounts of drugs including but not limited to; wellbutrin, lamictal, lithium, clozapine, and fluoxetine hcl. However, i moved over seas for a study abroad and was taken off of my medications. When I returned to the US I was unable to afford to go back on my medication or to go to a therapist. I was alright for a while doing outside activities and smoking marijuana as a way to calm my anxiety and to help sleep. 

Current Problem: I cant seem to control my depression or my anxiety. They are in conflict which causes severe mental breakdowns usually taking place in public places when I am met with a challenge that I am too depressed to deal with but also am to anxious to not deal with. Most often in classes (College student). I haven't been able to sleep or eat properly resulting in more negative feelings. Every now and then (like now) I am able to look at the issues logically and take them on but it quickly regresses to the screaming, crying, hyperventilating until I pass-out part of me that I cant control. 
I am having horrible nightmares (PTSD symptom) that are more disturbing than they have been in the past causing nausea and vomiting most mornings.

I don't know where else to really go. I went to the hospital after throwing up blood (Diagnosed to be pancreatitis) but was treated then quickly sent on my way. I don't know how to get help that I can afford and I am scared that I will try to kill myself during one of my fits. I don't want to tell people that though because they will send me back to an institution. Going back to an institution is my biggest fear, I am so close to graduation... I feel lost. I don't even really know what I am asking or trying to do by writing here.

It happened to me last July, when I had previously been really anticipating the New Horizons Pluto flyby. Since Pluto is my favorite planet, I was terrified of fucking up my once in a lifetime experience to watch a major scientific event in real time/near real time. And yet, I ended up completely ruining my opportunity to watch the live feeds of the events and the reactions,  when I instead had to miss the damn thing because I had to go to a social outing.

That social outing was cancelled and I never got the message; and I never got the message because I smashed my phone in a fit of rage a few weeks prior, and forgot to notify them of a phone number change due to switching carriers.

And this year it happened again, I finally have the best roommate I've had in my group home, and I didn't want it to change. Once again I fucked it up in a fit of rage after the GH provider gaslighted me; and now I'm being forced to move out.

Right now, my biggest, deepest fear of them all, is finally having true love come to me, only for me or them to die almost immediately. Those wedding night or honeymoon tragedies you see on the news and in the movies are prime examples of that. How do I stop myself from causing it to come true?

As a result, I've deliberately refused to put any more effort in finding someone as I refuse to accept this risk, especially knowing my FUCKING IDIOT SELF! And especially because I know the universe will be cruel to me in that way for a fact, regardless of whether or not such a death is my fault or not.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Is there a name for that specific psychological phenomenon where we ourselves cause the one thing we fear the most to happen anyway?

Today, I was locked out of my Twitter account. That might sound dumb and inconsequential but for me it was important because I was cut off from a lot of my friends and social interaction I don't otherwise get. I'm quite a lonely person and being cut off from that social interaction has left me feeling lonely all day.

I was pregnant once, my boyfriend at the time told me he wanted me to have an abortion so I did. I wanted that baby so badly, but keeping it alone wasn't an option. My friends and family wouldn't have understood.

I don't want to be alone forever, in a stupid rental house with a cat.

I always considered myself at least fairly intelligent. I was usually around the top of my class, and I never struggled with any subject, but now my life is going down a straight slope to hell at an average velocity of 12m/s with constant acceleration of 1.5m/s.

I wanted to become a theoretical physicist, perhaps a mathematician. Maybe a chemist. Something to do with science, just because of my sheer fascination with how things work (though I utterly despise geology). I really, really want to be a part of these big discoveries. I want to share my knowledge, be educated. I want to be a successful, intelligent human being capable of contribution.

Unfortunately, my bubble has been burst. This little alternate universe I've been living has completely blinded me. I am no longer even aware of reality. I was living in this dream world, in which I am actually intelligent, and absolutely capable of reaching my sky-high goals.

I've been torn out of this dream... I can't believe it... Now I've realized that I am in-fact sub-average at best.

I am not good at algebra. I am not good at traditional physics (I love the concepts, but actually calculating shit and completing equations is awful. Creating equations is fun, and so is solving them, but I hate working with graphs and stuff). I am not good with... Anything, really. I'm just a below-average student with no qualities what-so-ever.

I've got school exams (Must be in the top 60 to get into high school in this country, otherwise I'm out) in two weeks. I'm bound to fail. 

I've been depressed this whole year, because I doubt my own intelligence. I don't think I'm fit for the profession of a physicist, mathematician, chemist or engineer. I've got all the passion. All the grit. All the determination... But I just haven't got the brain power.

Most of the stuff I see in these exams, I've never learned in my school! I'm in 9th grade, and these word problems! Some of them are insanity itself! 

I feel so terrible that I feel like suicide is truly the only logical resolution to my issues!

Sure, you could argue that there are other paths in life, but let me make this clear...

I will not sweep the floor.
I will not work a minimum wage job.
I will not join the military.
I will not do manual work (I'm horrible with manual jobs).
I will not do any other jobs that are, while being extremely important, quite petty. Not to insult anyone who has such a job. You do a very important job that not many others, including myself, would be willing to take.

And so I conclude this chapter of my life. It may be the last. I'm sticking to the script, or I'm ending the book prematurely. But I will never take an alternate path.

Edit: And yes. Smiling emoticons make me very sad. I do some stuff on Khan Academy, and when I get the equation right, that nice tune plays as the smiling face stares into my soul. It makes me feel happy. So happy that it literally brings me to tears. That smiling face, that friendly tune... In that moment, I feel like someone is standing behind me, reassuring me that everything will be alright. My throat swells up and I can't help but smile back.

My mom cosigned the loans (bless her heart, she only wants whats best for me) and I was set for the first two years... 

Straddled in debt already but doing quite well, I managed to finish my first two years with a 3.7 gpa. Part of that was because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life (still don't) so I was taking mostly intro classes and electives to fill my schedule. After these two years were up I made the single biggest mistake in my life... I decided to transfer to an even nicer out of state school, even more expensive, and again my mom cosigned the loans. When I got there I got a cushy one person apartment, paying rent with loans (dumbest thing I could have ever done, even though I still am) and that's when the depression, sickness or whatever hit me. I was super lonely, literally never made one friend and contemplated suicide daily even though I will probably never have the balls to do it until my mom is dead and there is no one left in my life that matters. 

Needless to say, I never attended class and slept almost all day in what was basically a prison cell to me, even though it would be seen as an outstanding opportunity to a normal person. I failed out(mainly dropped out) the first semester, never got my refund for the first or SECOND semester and took the second semester off. 

Fast forward to now and I'm in my second semester at my third school. I'm now in state, surrounded by quite a few of my high school friends who also attend here but I'm still stuck in the same rut. I'm watching all my friends from high school graduate this year as they branch out and live their lives. Meanwhile I'm stuck in limbo land where I'm already over 100k in debt, with literally nothing to show for it. I'm in the same boat as my second school basically.

 I received an academic warning last semester and so far it's looking like I'm going to be suspended because I'm skipping class and feeling depressed daily. Although this school does offers a third chance, which I want to take because if not I'll be thrown into the real world paying off my student loans with no skills or experience to do any kind of meaningful work. I'd be homeless if it wasn't for my mom. And if I do fail out, I'll move back in with my mom and (alcoholic) dad, where my brother who never went to college also lives. I really wish I was in my brother's situation because yeah sure he never went to college, but he also won't be straddled in crippling debt for the rest of his life.

My whole life has literally boiled down to the idea that I NEEDED to go to college to make something of my life. And now that I'm in insurmountable amounts of debt, I see that I completely fucked up and wish I never went there in the first place.

I want to kill myself because then it will all go away. Everything. The saddest part is my mom will be left with the loans because she has been the greatest thing that ever happened to me and supported me all the way, signing her life away as well. I'm in a lose lose situation. What can I possibly do? Should I see a doctor? Or am I stuck feeling like this forever and the only way out is death?",depression,t5_2qqqf,I need help...

Probably the biggest way I've messed up is in school. I'm a college freshman, and last semester I got C's and D's in my major specific classes. I tried to kill myself a few times after that so I wouldn't have to talk to my parents about it, but I couldn't go through with it. Over winter break, my parents and I spoke about my future and we agreed it would be best if I switched majors. I didn't really intend on doing that though, because I just planned on killing myself as soon as I got back to campus. Since I planned on killing myself, I didn't go to classes, and I haven't been all semester. I also never changed my major like my parents suggested. I've attempted at least 5 times since then, but I've never been able to do it. I've spent hours pacing on a ledge, knowing that it would be so much easier to jump than fix my life, but some primal part of me keeps me from jumping. Maybe if I had something quick like a gun I could do it, but that's beside the point. Anyway, it's almost the end of the semester and I have to make a decision soon. Either I kill myself (probably tonight) or I try and fix my life. Since I've attempted so many times but never gone through with it, attempting again seems kind of pointless. But on the other hand, I've dug myself such a deep hole that I can't see any other way out. I'm not asking for someone to solve all my problems for me, I'd just like some outside input.

I was finally able to find a place who accepted my insurance and was in my network. They set up an intake appointment and I went. What was odd is they had me pay copay, so when my insurance's behavioral health coordinator called me again (every two weeks I get a call), we tried to find out what was going on with my insurance, and they told us that I wasn't supposed to be paying copay, that it should be waivered and reimbursed. Well I told this to the lady who makes my appointments at the doctor's office this week when I went and she said that I had to pay a copay, according to my insurance but that she will call again. She called me earlier and said that I do have to pay, so I called my insurance and it turns out that they stopped accepting my plan/being part of my network around the time when I made the first appointment and when I went there, I wasn't told this. So that's why they had me pay. So now I'm going to have to stop going and find someone else if I can.

i guess i have no idea if i really have depression or if i'm just a whiny wimp
for the past two years(mostly last year, the last few months was the worst...also i've been self harming for 2 years) it's been...weird(best word to describe it)
for two days I can be okay, i'm never really happy mostly due to my personality(I am incredibly jealous of everyone and everything, I am never happy with my life even if something good happened, I hate everything about my life even though so many others have it worse... which just makes me hate myself for that. It's a shitty cycle.) and then there are these nights when I just stare at the computer screen, unable to do anything but go to the bathroom and cut myself
then while i'm at school or something and i'm doing okay i suddenly feel like crying and this happens a lot
or when i am with my friends i just sometimes... stop functioning. i stare blankly and i just feel incredibly fake, like i am forcing myself to continue seeming normal. it's not exactly a feeling of sadness, more like numbness? no idea how to describe it.
i'm also very self critiquing and i hate my personality(i dont care about my looks) and i think my life is the most boring shit and i honestly am waiting to be teleported into a fantasy movie
i'm also a horrible person because i hate my mom and i'm incredibly rude to her even though she's the best and kindest mom that would do everything for me, i make her cry on a weekly basis and i sometimes hate myself for that but i just can't stand her. 
a lot of people tell me that i ignore them, or that i am rude for avoiding them, but i don't do that on purpose. i just get lost in my  own little world and stop functioning for a few minutes a few times a day.(its most likely not anxiety)
i cant maintain a friendly relationship with normal people, because i am horrible. I lost my best friend because i've been so rude to her and didn't even attempt any effort to get her back because i cant seem to bring myself to care
when my grandmother died i honestly didn't give a fuck even though i was close to her
i don't care about anything but at the same time i care about everything
i'm the rudest person but at the same time i can be kind and understanding
and i feel like i hate every single person in this world(in real life, online friends are okay) even though i was never bullied. I'm not narcissistic, no i actually bring myself lower than others
but it's like everyone has flaws that annoy the hell out of me. every fucking one and i hate being so negative i honestly didn't sign up for this, I actually want to be a cheerful person and bright and ambitious but i just can't
sorry for the long post and idk if it's anything serious just thought i'd try to get some advice. at first i really discarded the thought of having depression or any other mental ilness because i was sure i was just a wimp and i had to grow up because everyone has down times. I was sure depression meant being sad all the time but now that i researched it i thought i might actually have it, but i'm not sure so i'd just rather ask than go auto-diagnosing myself

And yeah, going back over this I feel like I'm fishing for support/other people to be proud of me, and I'm not proud of that. My feeling okay about making good decisions should be enough. Maybe it's not. But this isn't about how I sometimes actually make less-shitty decisions...I want to be proud of **YOUR** accomplishments, because I know how hard some of them can be and want to be proud with you.

Sometime last night I got kinda down and thought about having a beer to shut off my brain, then thought about taking an anxiety pill to do the same, then instead went downstairs and had some chocolate *without going over my calorie budget*. So I turned an impulse to self medicate (potentially destructively) into a benign pick me up. Plus...I stretched today! I sometimes joke about being as flexible as a brick, but seriously: at karate almost as much of my reputation came from not being flexible as it came from not giving a fuck if I got hit. The ""You call that a punch? my depression hits 12x harder!"" mentality may have had something to do with it.

I made another health decision last night I can be proud of but would rather not admit considering such a stupidly bad decision...and uh...sometimes you don't have to resort to drastic measures to get out of feeling pretty shitty, I guess (it wasn't about suicide).

And I'm planning a hike that would definitely have been impossible 10 months and 85lbs ago and may still be impossible now...I'm thinking next weekend I'm gonna try to burn 2000 Calories in a single hike.

Next step in life progression: talking about getting a job even though my dad is dying, because he doesn't need my help 90% of the time and I need not to be peter pan.

But *now that I've talked WAY too much about myself*, **what've you done lately that was a good health decision I can be proud of with you?** The last day, the last week, the last month...whenever! Did you get out of bed even though depression made it suck? Did you shower (+10 adult points!)? Or maybe you turned down your coworkers for drinks even though it was hard? (If you chose not to go out with them /u/isotopes, I'm proud of you!, if you went anyway, that seems fairly normal and is understandable). Or maybe you're fed up with the side effects of your med but are taking it anyway until you can get taken off it without risking an episode? That one can be tough, and if you're doing it I want to say *I'm proud of you*.

I have had severe depression for some time now.  I am 23 almost 24 years old.  I feel like I waste my life big time.  I mostly just sleep a big portion of the day or lay around.  I have little drive, happiness or modivation to live.  I have not had a job for over a year, I have been working with state Vocational Rehab to get back to work but no luck.  I did go to Jr. College and earn an associates degree and since then I have been home, i've had a few seasonal jobs in the past but thats it.

The job market here sucks, not that I probably couldn't of found something if I tried hard enough even though things work against me(gaps in resume not much of a resume etc.)  Biggest thing is I have extreme fear about working and being able to commit to a job.  I am so tired all the time and the depression is part of it.

I have thought about trying to go back to school but im afraid I wont be able to do it and have too much panic and come back home.  I dont know what to do anymore.  Other than I know i've wasted a lot of time and just feel horrible, anxious empty devoid of life everyday.

I am not suicidal, but I do think about it often.  I think im too afraid.

A couple of weeks ago I was browsing the internet and I was reading that the mirror image isn't how others view you? I was really confused, so I looked into it a bit more and it came that the mirror actually inverses our reflection so I should check my true image; how others see me, by taking a selfie on my phone. (I've never been fond of taking pics) I took one, the image flipped and I felt sick. My face was so asymmetrical and lopsided. I couldn't even recognise myself. It said that the intensity of your reaction would be increased depending on how often you looked in the mirror, I look in the mirror A LOT.

We had dated almost a year.  I had had so many issues and bad things happening but she too had some smaller ones.  There were so many times where I wanted to break up with her because I figured I could never be with her because of her small problems but I never wanted to break up because I loved her too much.  The last two months since she broke up with me my depression and anxiety got 1000x worse and I've literally been suffering from crippling panic attacks and insanely severe depression and dark thoughts almost all relating to her and not having her and wanting her back more than anything in the world.  Since we broke up I've been telling her I've been wanting her back and I that I've changed a lot.  A couple weeks ago I wrote a really long letter and printed out a picture of us both and was planning to bring both and flowers to her apartment at school in person and ask if she wanted to get coffee to talk.  Days before I was gonna go she texted me saying she needs to be single for a while.  I then called her and calmly talked and i even told her about what i was planning to do with the letter and things and she said at least until next semester starts in the fall she needs to be single. I asked her if in the fall we could have a chance at talking again and she said yes.  The next day after that she messaged me because she was at home and her mom made her really upset and she wanted to talk to me.  I went about the conversation calmly and said I do want a chance so bad in the fall but I understand she needs her time now and I respect that.  Later that night she messaged me drunk and the conversation was similar.  A week or so after that on a saturday night I saw about twenty minutes after she sent it she asked ""can i come over"" along with two missed calls at 1am. I then called her and she said can i come over and was at her friends house and I said of course you know I want that and she said actually let me call you back in ten I need to think if its a good idea or not. Twelve minutes went by and no call so I called her and went to voicemail.  Then she called me back a couple minutes after and said i didn't need to come.  Twenty minutes later I was in bed and my phone vibrated and she said she wanted to come to drive her to her apartment so I then left and got her.  Her apartment was ten minutes away and she was somewhat drunk and kissed me when she got in, then started crying about how I mistreated her, then I started talking calmly about how I want a chance so bad in the fall, then when I went to drop her off she said to park for a minute.  I did, then we started kissing, I put my hand up her shirt, she started giving me head for 40 seconds while I put my hand down her jeans to her ass, and then she said she needed to go.  I got out to help her and she said can we get back together, I said its what I want, then she said not until next semester while she was kind of crying.  The next morning she texted ""sorry for last night.""  I called her and said I just want a chance in the fall and she was like yes i already said yes but she was like I can't promise anything 1000%.  I then said I'm just worried she'll be with someone else and she then said its unlikely but obviously she can't promise 1000%. I then said I wouldn't message her for a couple months and she said okay.  Then a couple days later on this past friday morning I woke up to a text she sent an hour before which from her which said something bad happened.  Several hours later I went to her apartment to help her even though she was reluctant at first, I was there five minutes and she was slightly uncomfortable and I gave her the things I brought that she needed and then said I just want to know for sure about the fall and she was like we already talked about this then I said so yes? and then she said yeah but said that she cant guarantee 1000%. she then thanked me for the stuff and I left.  Then this morning I woke up to a missed call from her last night at 3:30 am when she was obviously drunk and so I texted her saying ""I missed your call last night, is everything okay"" and she messaged back ""Yes I'm sorry for calling"" and i didn't message back after.


I'm very sorry I made this so long I'm just very very very mentally sick right now and every little thing triggers me about her.  I stopped jacking off a week after we broke up because sex, sex stimuli, thoughts about sex or her literally make me truly want to die.  I can't even see commercials with females at the moment and any smell that reminds me of sex triggers me like crazy wanting to die because I don't have her and she's free now to have sex with other guys.  I know there's five months between now and next semester and that when i asked she said in the fall we can have a chance to talk again I'm just so scared she won't take me back or she'll meet someone else or change her mind.


Days after we broke up I jacked off to pictures of her boobs and her ass I have locked away that she had texted me so so so long and it was so bad because after I just missed her and wanted to die.  I used to have an addiction to porn and jacking off but was fading for over a year now and the last almost two months because of my severe triggers I didn't even want to and havent since a week after she broke up with me.


I don't have any desire at all to jack off literally none, and that is the truth, I just want to stop thinking about all these dark thoughts about her and I don't know if jacking off to regular porn would help me after I cum, like if part of my huge attraction to her will be subsided for some time because I'll feel more free.  I'm literally in the most pain ive ever experienced in my entire life and have been sleeping almost all day every day because everything else I try to do doesn't help.  I've been on zoloft three weeks now after trying other things for the last many months that didn't work but it isn't working yet.  I have two therapist appointments this week and one appointment Wednesday with the psychiatrist where I'll ask him to increase my zoloft dose because it isn't working yet and for xanax which I know he won't give me because he never does.  I almost went to the hospital many times the past couple weeks and especially the last couple days because i literally can't exist at the moment.  


I know I need medicine to start working immeadielty and to start making changes and getting healthy for myself first and I won't message her probably until july at all and I have to wait till the fall, it's just ive been talking to my friend and my sister and my parents about this im just terrified in the fall five months from now she wont take me back or that she'll change her mind or she won't give me a chance or tell me that she's met someone else even though its unlikely or that she'll tell me she just want to move on.  I really put her through a lot the last many months of us dating and she said before she's afraid if we get back that I'll be good again the beginning and it will get bad later.

Because of school commitments we drifted apart but recently everything has come crashing down and we've all had to admit we have a problem. For anonymity and ease of understanding, all three of us are P, J and B(me). 

We have all been suffering with the same sort of symptoms for over a year now, but only P has been diagnosed with depression. J and myself have never worked up the courage to see a GP. Last month, we discovered how badly we were all suffering. I worked up the guts to see the school councillor because I've been feeling so low and miserable and angry for over a year and had been feeling suicidal and I saw P in the waiting room after. P and myself then discussed things the next day and he revealed he had been self harming with a syringe, taking out blood. Later on, he overdid it and has been to hospital twice. I later discovered J has also been feeling depressed for almost exactly the same amount of time and has not seen a councillor and has self harmed with a steak knife. In this amount of time, I have hit rock bottom and self harmed with a knife three times in the last two weeks and I regret to say that last week I walked to a river bank and stood there for an hour just arguing with myself over whether I should just walk in and end it. 

I'm worried about them. Both of them. P is going to repeat the year, J is going to uni (he has an unconditional so he hasn't got the worry of exams like I do) and I'm going to a very far away uni, although possibly the same uni as J if I don't get into my firm choice.

I'm struggling with exams and wondering if I'll make it, but I'm scared for these two.

• If someone criticizes me for any reason, regardless of who they are or what they're saying, they are 100% correct and I take their words to heart.

• If someone praises me for any reason, particularly if I have asked for their opinion on something, it cannot be depended on as an accurate (or even honest) assessment of the situation.

• The most critical opinion regarding anything that pertains to me is always assumed to be the correct one.

• I do not have the judgement necessary to determine for myself whether or not I am right or wrong.

• My character flaws are more numerous and more serious than those of ordinary people.

• Everyone who I have ever encountered, regardless of how they conducted themselves around me, came away with the impression that something was ""different"" about me.

• I am almost universally seen as extremely socially awkward and lacking in self-awareness.

• People constantly talk about me whenever I'm not present, to a far greater extent than they do about others.

• By arguing against a person's negative assessment of my character, I am merely demonstrating my own overconfidence by wrongfully attempting to invalidate someone else's perfectly reasonable point of view.

• I have not accomplished anything of merit in my life, and have no reason to feel confident in my own abilities.

• If I feel that a woman is flirting with me, it is safe to assume that she is either leading me on, or (far more likely) that I am misinterpreting her cues.

• From an objective standpoint, I am extremely unattractive and undesirable.

• Women are incapable of feeling genuine sexual or emotional attraction to me.

• Asking a woman out when she has given no signs of interest is inappropriate and presumptuous, as it stems from the belief that I am worthy of her time and attention based on my own merits.

• I will not attain upward mobility at any point in my life, as I lack the focus necessary to achieve long-term goals.

• I lack the emotional maturity of ordinary people my age.

• I have little of value to offer the world.

I just want people's ideas as I can't realistically go to my GP and talk through the possibility of having bipolar, because I don't expect them  to have adequate knowledge (IME GPs are pretty crappy when it comes to mental health) and because there isn't time (appointments are hard to come by and are short).

I am very moody. I am so moody that I doubt that I could have the type of bipolar where moods last for months, and my moods also seem too changeable for me to have rapid-cycling bipolar. They can change within hours, and I don't know if this is just normal being-depressed-but-having-good-moods-sometimes or something else? I think of myself as having depression because lack of motivation, tiredness, self-hatred, etc, are very common for me (and lately I've been thinking about suicide a lot, which is why I made an account on here), but I definitely experience a lot of good moods, although I think they tend to be mixed - for example I'll feel happiness but at the same time I'll think about suicide? I definitely don't experience full-blown mania but I sing on the streets and do things like consider applying for an internship at a really big-name magazine (in spite of having no paid work experience worthy of putting on a CV), and life can feel amazing. I've been prescribed Citalopram for my 'low mood' (my practice appears allergic to the word 'depression') but I'm hesitant to take it as I'm worried about side effects... The only explanations I can think of for my moodiness (if it isn't normal) are it being due to some type of bipolar, to BPD (which a professional has never suggested to me, perhaps because I'm not impulsive, by my account) or it being a result of autism (which I'm in the process of being diagnosed with). A hormonal imbalance?? Does anyone else here have similar experiences? My mother was diagnosed with bipolar when she was younger because she had depression and mania that involved psychosis, something I've never experienced.

I don't know if this is the right place for this... there is a whole backstory to why I am sad but... I can't change anything about the past and don't have the strenght to try to summarize it now...  
I don't know why I post this... I went to therapy for the first time yesterday. Was so nervous... It was the 4th time that someone in this body was there (I have some sort of dissociative disorder) so he already knew some things about me and I knew a bit what he is like... 

And he was really nice... I wish there was some way to go there and cry and him to console me..... and it is embarassing but I think about what it would be like if he hugged me.... I know he most likely would not do that and even asking would be a boundary violation by me.
And I am scared that he would throw us out if I'd ask...

We've only been there 4 times... and I already beginn to be attached.... this is very dangerous.... but I can't help it...  
I feel so vulnerable and alone... 

I don't know what to do. I don't even know if there is any way he can help me... don't know if a hug would even help  or not.... that is my second fear after him kicking us out for wanting that...that he'd actually do it and it would not help... or that it would and I would wish for it again but at some point it would of course stop because we can't be in therapy for our whole life...  
That is another reason why this attachement is dangerous... we only started but at some point the therapy will end and I am already scared of that...

I hate being like this... so clingy and needy and feeling like a lost child... being like this actually caused me to be in this situation and being so sad... but that is way to complicated...

I should sleep... it is almost midnight... the others in this body need sleep to function... they do everything... I just sit around and am sad whenever I am in the body... most of the others are not sad...

I'm a 23Y/F and I've suffered with depression, social anxiety and a little bit of OCD tendencies since around the age of 12. I was diagnosed last year. I've had suicidal thoughts for years, but I've never come so close to acting on them. I've recently hit rock bottom. My husband (27Y) of 2 years has recently left me, I'm a mother of a 6 and 1.5 year old. I have never clung to anyone in my life like I did my husband. We clung to each other. When we met he wasn't my cup of tea. He's military but he hung out in the bars nightly and was a social media addict, CONSTANTLY feeding off the attention of other people and more so women. He's not that attractive of a guy, but his method is to make people feel bad for him. This comes in to play later. During our relationship he made a total turn around. He completely stopped the bar scene, he was committed, but we had our issues. I have BAD trust issues, because of people like him. I always thought deep down, he would always have the want to be the bachelor I originally met. We had trouble in the sex department and he tried his hardest to please me. He tried to show me he was loyal but something just never felt right. I know he didn't cheat on me, but I developed some screaming loud insecurities that continued to plague our relationship. This relationship was the hardest, yet most rewarding thing I've ever felt (I've been married one other time). He has PTSD. He has really bad anger issues. Fast forward a little and this is what has been happening in the past year. He wasn't happy. I think he realized he couldn't be the family man I needed.  I have a college degree and am a licensed funeral director though i'm not practicing because he wanted me to stay home with the kids. We had one vehicle we bought brand new together. He started leaving us. He took the only transportation, canceled my debit cards, and left us for days at a time with no transportation, money, food, etc. (My only family lives 3 hours away and we don't have the greatest relationship). It started off for a few days a month, then he'd leave for a week. Then he'd take off for two weeks out of the month, and eventually he was leaving us with absolutely nothing more than he was home. He promised he would stop, he would scream in my face, back me into a corner so I could feel the spit on my face as he was telling how much he fucking hated me. I spent in total, MONTHS alone with my two kids over the coarse of a year. He left us in a snow storm, with the power out for 12 hours, and only offered to get the kids to take them somewhere warm but I had to stay. The thing is, I never saw him as a monster. When we were happy, it was euphoric. I felt so safe. He had to leave for work for 3 weeks in March. I knew when he left, he wasn't going to come back. I felt it in the pit of my stomach. I knew when he kissed me goodbye, it would be the last one. And i was right. I haven't seen him in 6 weeks and he says he's filling for a divorce. I'm allowed to live in our home for another month, then my kids and I are out in the street, I've contacted my family, they can't help me. I will have no where to go, no job, no money, no vehicle, and no one to help me with my children to try to get any of the above. I have spent EVERY SINGLE DAY the last 6 weeks becoming more hysterical. They say it gets easier over time but each day I'm slipping more and more. And I miss him so much. You don't know how many times I've put a rope around my neck. I've never felt this kind of pain before, in all my years of depression and heartbreak. He has already started scoping out new women and I have had multiple people tell me they spotted him in the bars. He's telling the world on social media how horrible our marriage was on social media to get the attention of others, and the saddest part is, he's getting it. A lot of it. I was right all along, he was that guy. How does someone pretend for so long and SO good? What am I supposed to do? I have no resources. I have no other options, I want out. I'm afraid of myself, and I can't keep going like this. I've never been so close to ending it, and if I didn't have two little girls, I wouldn't be here writing this right now.

* College is just getting worse and worse. I got a 39 on a homework last night and a 0 on a literature test. All my previous semesters have been great, especially considering how shit I was at high school, so I have deemed this semester a loss but it still fucking sucks getting those grades. 

* Overall it just sucks not having friends, and not being able to meet any. My community college is a social recluse with 0 clubs or anything to make friends but I can't afford to transfer yet. I do everything alone; movies, coffee, shopping, lunch. It's just me.

I have friends at home but I get worried when they don't reply to my messages, I'm scared that they hate me and are just putting up with me. But the more I ask them whether this is the case the more fed up they seem to get. I know it's hard being around someone like me, I just wish I could be normal. I don't sleep much, I can't fall asleep and I've tried all the different methods, none of them seem to work. 

I guess I just feel like I don't belong. Everyone else has found their friend groups, and everyone else has someone to trust, and often someone to sleep with. I knew being a virgin going into uni would be tough, but I have no self confidence. I hate the way I look, I can't take compliments whatsoever and the only relief I have from this is my music. It's the only thing keeping me sane, and right now I'm worried that I'm losing that too.

It's the smallest of things that can send me into a spiral. Somebody choosing to sit further away from me than usual, someone not replying to my messages on Facebook. I can't stop the paranoia that people secretly hate me. I feel lost.

My brother let me know he was ready to leave (he got me the job and works in a different part of the building) so I got up to go.

So I've been hanging out with this girl for about a year. We see each other almost every week and she tutors me in math. We have a lot of fun and I noticed she was kind of flirting with me the last few weeks (she plays with her hair, laughs at my dumb jokes, frequent eye contact, smileys in every text msg she sends, etc.)

I was going to ask her out on a date this week and I prepared myself mentally.

My mood has been going great the last few weeks and I saw her this week. She talked about how busy she is because of school and then says that she started seeing someone (the way she said meant that they weren't official yet, they are just starting, she barely gave any details) and that she can't see him often cause of school. She noticed my mood change and ask if i was tired and alright, i said i was fine and not tired.

After our tutoring session was done, I felt immense sadness. (I didn't ask her out btw). I really wanted to cut myself and my suicidal thoughts came back. I layed in bed listening to emo for a few hours and then I texted her to tell her to cancel our next tutoring session because I knew if I would go I would only be torturing myself.

I was going to ask her out earlier this year, but I thought it wasn't a good idea while my depression was taking over me. I want to tell her something, but I don't know what. I have a hard time expressing myself and I really don't want to fuck this up.

I haven't felt this shitty since january and I feel that all the progress I went through (therapy /antidepressants) have been wasted and that I'll have to restart all over again. This is also ruining my sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night and think of her and the pain and then I can't go back to sleep. I'm asking myself if she said that she was seeing someone to make me jealous, cause I don't understand why she would flirt with me for so long.

tldr: Girl flirts with me, says she is seeing someone, I receive mixed signals and my mental health is deteriorating because of this.

I will be all photos and stories by then, and you'll wonder why they get told, and you'll wonder who I was beyond these snapshots. In a way, I hope you don't, it would make your life easier and that's all I care about. Here's an non-glamorized perspective, told without the lens of grief and retrospect: I was terrible to live with, I was loud and stroppy and annoying. My emo phase lasted too long. I was in my room too much, and I talked too much while the TV was playing. I never gave you enough attention, I never taught you as well as I should have. If you remember one thing about me, I want it to be the bedtime stories. As much as I complained sometimes, they were the favorite part of my day, I'm glad my stupid accents amused you so. I love you to the moon and back. Be good

Dad: our relationship was tumultuous and difficult. I'm sorry I didn't see you more. I've cherished out deep conversations, and I've learnt so much from you that I can't put into words. You gave me a curiosity and a passion for knowledge that had gifted me so much in the world. My love of the stars, and of the universe, and of everything in it is a love that came from you.

Step-dad: I know you're not one for sappiness so please, just look after mum.

To my friends: You are all going to do so well, You're all so smart, and funny and supportive. I couldn't have asked for better. No more arguments please, guys? And whilst you'll all move on in a few years, and maybe none of you will keep in touch, I hope I'm always there in a way. Tell your children about me you fuckers, because I'm the reason we're all so awesome.

In short: I love you all. Sometimes when I close my eyes I see a vision so clear of your futures that it shocks me I wont be there. Just know I really wanted to be. I tried so hard to be. I'm sorry I failed.

I realize reading this now it sounds like I had a terrible life. I didn't. It was a good life, a fucking good life. I was loved, and I did love. I read and watched and talked. I shared my ideas and heard so many in return. I laughed and ran, I stretched out my arms and hoped for the future, for the dreams that kept me alive for the longest of times. So I do this with the least amount of sadness as possible, because I see that vision. I see a future in ten years, whether in togetherness or separation. I see everyone's little families thriving, and I see a good life, in which I am a glimmer on the horizon and a fond memory.

My name was Evelyn, and I didn't do much, but I had so much fun whilst doing it. I read a lot, and watched movies. I sung and danced. I failed and succeeded. I could make an incredible pasta sauce. I did kick-ass impressions, thank you very much. I loved you all, intensely, and that was, in a way, my biggest flaw. Thank you for reading.

She was the only thing keeping me alive and the only happiness I had in my life. I got so attached to her. I didn't realise it at the time but she was the reason I stayed awake until times like 3am, just because I wanted to talk to her for as long as possible. She left me. She fucking left me and here I am, every fucking day crying to the memories I had with her, wishing to go back in time to be happy again. Sure now I have other people, who try to make me feel happy and I feel so bad if I don't pretend to be happy so I have to, day in day out. She's also said she hates me. A friend messaged her for me and she said, and I quote:

&gt;Let me rephrase that question, don't you think if I missed him at all I would say sorry or whatever? I thought he could take a hint.

She was the only thing I had, the only sunshine in my life and this happens. It's been about a month now and I've already attempted suicide 2 times, both times the rope snapped. What the fuck have I become? I'm fucking useless, I have no redeeming qualities, I'm just a suicidal fuck with nowhere to belong because of my suicidal tendencies. She also said to that friend, and I quote again:

&gt;Tbh though he once told me he thinks he has gender dysphoria. That's complete bs. Gender dysphoria doesn't exist, he's just yearning for the attention of me because he's a little attention whoring little shit. I never liked him and never will, he's always been a pain in the ass and I only stuck with him because if he comitted suicide I'd blame myself. I was only looking out for myself, that's it.

I bet everyone thinks this. Nobody actually likes me. I just need someone I can put my complete trust in, someone who UNDERSTANDS me, someone who doesn't treat me differently because of my depression. 
It will never happen though. I'm a socially awkward fuck who has to try really hard not to have a panic attack while in lessons panicking about if I'm actually learning the stuff. I'm a depressed fuck who can't reveal his true self to anyone because if I do they will leave like all the rest in my life did. I'll never be happy because of who I am. The one making me unhappy is *myself.* But I can't do anything about it. I'm me, and that me is someone who has no hope in happiness.

All I want is someone to talk to about my depression. To make me happy, and actually understand me. But apparently none of my friends are capable of that. I reached out to a couple but they end up ignoring me half way through, like I'm not important at all.

TL;DR

Everyone left me, I'm a depressed fuck, I have no hope, Happiness will never come to me.

I suppose theres some things that support that theory. I get high sometimes(just on cough meds) and I've heard that it can make people have more empathy while on it.

*Am I okay?*

No, I don't think so. I haven't changed my clothes or showered in 4 days. My bed has become the place where I've been living for the past few days. My minor OCD has crept in. 

I've had to take the week off work due to physical illness at first, but staff started rumours that I wasn't really ill. Instead of fainting and vomiting in privacy during my breaks, apparently, according to them, I was ""crying in the toilets"" because I'm getting ""too emotional"" and ""it's coming across as rude"". Consequentially, the rumour mill achieved what it wanted and I ended up actually bawling my eyes out on the way home that day. And, boom, look at that, my severe anxiety has come back to bite at me again.

I'm not eating well. I can't even stomach water or herbal teas. I think I left my hand-towels and my food weighing scales at the flat I used to share with my former partner. I'm doing biazarre things. I occasionally have episodes of elation and mania during my depressive bouts.

I've gone to the doctor on multiple occasions recently, but all I can do is wait for a slot on the counselling/CBT waiting list to come up. It could take months. I only look forward to sleeping. I spend the entirety of the day trying to sleep the hours away. I'm researching and collecting pills, albeit herbal supplements or painkillers just to knock me out for most of the day.

I wake up to a panic attack every morning. I dream of my ex-partner every night. I still get the shakes and night sweats from AUD withdrawals. Every morning, I wake up and feel like the day ahead is too much of a task for me to take on. My goal is to make it pass as quick as possible until my next opportunity to sleep.

I am 26 years old.

I have struggled for a long time, I have felt suicidal before, but I always sort of had something pulling me back from going through with it, over the last few weeks though, I just feel like I need to make it stop, and the feeling of being pulled back from actually going through with it is gone. I don't want to put my family through that though.

I have gone through multiple drug addictions, all basically trying to get some rest and some escape from the constant exhausting anxiety, the first was Diazepam, the first time I tried that, I don't think I had ever felt relaxation before that point, it was amazing, I could talk to people, I could go out in public, my stomach didn't feel tight and my muscles didn't feel tensed up anymore, I felt like a new person, so of course, I was immediately hooked, I wanted to feel like that all the time, I quickly went from the usual 10mg a day to over 200mg a day, it wasn't sustainable. I managed to stop using that drug, I went through a horrendous withdrawal, but I stopped.

A year passed, I struggled along, I managed to work a job, then one day I discovered Codeine, and this was the first taste of Opiates I ever had, the feeling was of course, incredible, relaxed and not anxious like with Diazepam, but better, the euphoria was amazing, its not an easy thing to put into words how amazing Opiates make you feel.

I quickly grew tolerant to Codeine, and moved on to Oxycodone, then finally onto Heroin. I was officially the person i never wanted to become, my father, who suffers from bipolar disorder, has always been a Heroin addict, and all my life i never wanted to become that, but i did.

Life went on, I lost my job, I could feel glorious with the drug, but with a terrible guilt also. I used and used, medicating my problems with the drug I had always sworn to myself I would never be involved with. I finally got into a methadone program eventually. 

Thats my basic story, for the last 10 years or so at least, now here I am, I feel very hopeless, I feel like a complete failure at everything, I feel guilty for using the drugs I have used. I get scared of what damage I have done to my body. So many thoughts constantly run through my head non stop all the time, I just can't stand to live like this anymore. I just don't know what to do or where to go from here. I just want it all to stop so badly. 

I'm sorry for such a long post, I feel strange posting this, like why should anyone care about my life, people have there own problems, why should I expect anyone to read about my life and my problems.

I just need to be heared out and a bit of advice. I'm gonna tell you a bit about myself, mostly my stupid illness. 

I was diagnosed 4 years ago. I had graduated high school and was eager to start college. But I couldn't concentrate, and my memory turned to shit. I also couldn't get up from bed most days. I went from a very good student to someone who skipped class all the time to stay home and sleep and someone who failed every exam and assignment. 
So I had to drop out of college to get treatment. 

I spent a whole year zombie like looking for the right medication, having no autonomy of my own. My mom had to take care of me. So I would see my friends hanging out and going out on Facebook and I would just stay home wishing I was dead. It was horrible. Once I finally started feeling better, not like my old self, but better compared to how I was at my most sick, I wanted to go back to school and finish what I started. But I had to be on academic probation and that sounded like a lot of stress, didn't wanna fall ill again so I passed. 

I decided to go to beauty school. I have come to regret that decision but at the time it seemed like a good idea. I had something to keep me busy, a way to make new friends and a career, all in one. But I graduated and couldn't find a job. Everyone in this town asks for experience, but I can't have experience if I don't have a job. Every single place I applied to denied me. So here I am 14k in debt and jobless. 

Spent another year after graduating beauty school doing God knows what. Just living with my parents and dwelling on my misery. Until one of my cousins in Mexico asked me to fly over there and teach her English. Sure why not. Gives me something to do. She paid for my plane ticket and let me stay with her. I even found a well paying job (for Mexican standards) there. I was happy I was being useful and financially independent. Until I got fired. So I decided to go back home with my parents one more time defeated.

So here we are. I have nothing going on for me. I don't have a college degree. I don't have a car, I don't even know how to drive. I have no work experience (only two jobs that lasted 2 months each). I have nothing going for me. I want to get out of this house and I want to be free and financially independent but it is impossible for me. I don't know what to do. And the suicidal thoughts are coming back. If I'm dead I don't have to worry about my future. I don't have to worry about all the dead end jobs I'll end up at. I don't have to worry about always having to make ends meet cause I'm unemployable. I honestly don't know what to do but I'm so tired of all this.

I had something happen in my life so I came to Reddit for advice. I didn't expect people to start attacking my character, calling me naive (making me feel stupid), saying I have judgment issues or some other deep issues that I should seek therapy for. I cried all night that night. I think they were coming from a good place, but those comments made me question who I was so I dug deep to see if they were right. But then I found nothing, so eventually I got over it, because I realized those people were wrong.

I posted on Reddit again about something else and someone attacked me on my morality. I told myself to not listen, they're wrong, they don't know you, they don't know the whole situation, and yet, it kept me up all night. Didn't cry this time, but it made me frustrated.

Why does it bother me so much?

I have social anxiety disorder and depression. These disorders probably contribute to my high sensitivity, right? And before you suggest it, yes, I am currently going to therapy.

I know what I need to tell myself already. I have been telling myself: they are literally just *opinions.* They are not *facts.* And yes, you know yourself better than a bunch of people on the internet, judging you on one situation they read on a computer screen. You're allowed to disagree with their opinions and move on. 

I don't know why I'm coming on here for advice again. I vowed to myself to never do that because I'm becoming a little bit afraid of people on the internet.

The problem is: whenever someone suggests there is something wrong with me, I freak out. Especially when I disagree with them.

To whom it may concern,

Let me preface this by talking about one of my recent fascinations. I’ve become fascinated with a perpetrator caught on Dateline NBC’s To Catch A Predator named Jeff Stacy. This guy is unappealing to all five senses. This guy sounds like Mickey Mouse, looks like a worse version of Craig from Malcolm In the Middle, looks like he has poor hygiene, and as a result probably smells, feels, and tastes awful. This guy waddles into the house like a duck and awkwardly answers all of the decoy’s statements with a mumbled “okay.” After Chris Hansen comes in he acts like he did nothing wrong and tries to justify himself showing up to solicit sex from a minor, as they all do. He claims “I didn’t know she was 15” and “the internet and real life aren’t the same thing.” In the typical funny TCAP moment, Chris Hansen looks at the transcript of the chat and says “You ask her if she likes to do anal. Is this appropriate for a 15 year old girl?” to which he responds “It’s a question!” This guy lies about his age; he tells Chris Hansen he’s 21 and tells the police that arrest him “I think I’m 25.” He’s actually 27. The real good parts are during the police interrogation. After he finds out he’s going to jail, be charged as a felon, and be registered as a sex offender, he continuously threatens to kill himself. In that Mickey Mouse voice over and over again “I’m just gonna kill myself. Death is all I have, all I want, all I need. Just put a bullet in my head. I want to slit my wrists. I’ll hang myself in my jail cell.”

I have developed an unhealthy fascination with this fucking episode. At one point the cops empty his pockets and he has dozens of keys, and when asked why he has so many keys, he answers “Why does it matter if I’m just gonna kill myself and be dead?” and they drop it. This leaves me unsatisfied. The cops should have pushed for an actual answer. Far too frequently I ponder to myself “Why the fuck did Jeff Stacy have so many fucking keys?” The point I’m getting at is, I watch this episode once in a while to feel better about myself. “Hey, I may be a worthless piece of shit but at least I’m not as bad as Jeff Stacy” I tell myself. I’ve seriously gotten to the point where in order to not 100% hate myself I need to compare myself to fucking potential child molesters. And you know what? Lately, I feel like I don’t even have a right to do that. Jeff Stacy is a worthless piece of shit and the world would be better off if he killed himself, but at least he had a drive to do something. Apparently he felt like his life had enough purpose that he could go out and have sex with a 15 year old. He had some kind of will to take his life and fucking do something with it. He felt like he deserved to be happy and sought ought a means of doing so. I honestly can’t say that about myself at this point.

I don’t want to do anything. I don’t like anything. I’ve never done anything. I’m 22 years old and still feel the exact same way I did when I was 14. I don’t know what it is; it’s probably just emotional immaturity, I’m emotionally stunted. I sincerely doubt it’s a serious developmental disorder like Asperger’s or arrested development but I sometimes wonder. I think it’s just circumstantial; this is just how things turned out. Things probably could have been different but turned out this way. I think back to when I was around the age of 14. I was a bitter angry kid, a problem child, constantly lashing out. It was all a cry for help but for some reason I never got help. I don’t know what else I could have done to cry even louder. Maybe I should have started cutting myself or doing drugs harder than weed or something.

I’m not trying to throw my family under the bus either, even though I really could. My mom was a drug addict who was never around, and when she was around made everything miserable. My dad never really did anything with me and I turned out to be a total pansy. I don’t resent anyone though. I understand that the only person who can change me is me and it’s my responsibility to do this, but I don’t have it in me. Regardless, I fucked up at the whole “life” thing too much. I should have matured emotionally but instead I’m a 22 year old who feels like an angsty 8th grader. I will never be a normal person. Nobody will ever want to seriously be associated with me.
Hollywood and the general American media tried to convince me “it gets better.” You know, being a kid sucks. Being a teenager sucks. Well, when the fuck does it actually get better? The only thing that’s really changed with me is the way my anguish and confusion manifests itself. First it was the lashing out and fucking shit up from about 12-15, then it became being emotionally withdrawn, weird and isolated from about 16-19, then a very slow process of trying to reintegrate myself into society from 20-22, which manifests itself in my bitterness coming out in small doses of sarcasm. Sure, I may have acted different during these times, but I’ve always felt the same.
I’m basically a junkie who isn’t on drugs. Fuck it, if I was on drugs things would probably be better. I’d basically be me as I am now, but with my perpetual anguish being interrupted by brief periods of opiate intoxication. I’m seriously a loser and I have nothing going for me. Other people don’t want to be involved with me and that’s probably a good choice. I simply can’t connect with other people. I don’t consider myself a misanthrope or anything like that, I actually do like other people. I have an adequate sense of social skills in terms of things like empathy, but people fucking terrify me. I’m not sure if I’m the problem or if it’s everyone else who is the problem, but either way I’m a lost cause. 

I’m the one who is inherently different from everyone else, even if I feel like I may be the more moral and kind hearted person most times. Every friend I’ve ever had has tried to change me and tell me what’s up, something I’ve never asked for. This has seriously happened about a dozen times. Whether it’s trying to get me to destruct property, sell drugs, get in fights, commit date rape, or various other things I don’t want to do, I’m always someone’s pet project. It‘s always someone trying to harden me. I’m always receiving life advice from people I don’t look up to even though they have somehow convinced themselves I do. I fucking hate that. I just tried to be your friend and you’re going to spend all the time telling we what’s up, what’s wrong with me, what I need to change, etc. So far I’ve been told about 6 different theories on girls and how to talk to them, all contradicting but spewed to me like objective fact that’s universally agreed upon by all men. I don’t need your help in getting laid. I can do it myself if I want to, I’ve done it before. I may not have had a serious girlfriend before but I have gotten laid, and regretted it each time. I’m not into promiscuity and womanizing. I’m too sensitive and honestly, a bit too much of a genophobe for that to work out.

I’m not looking forward to the rest of my life. Everyone always says “But you’re still so young. You don’t know what’s going to happen.” I don’t care what’s going to happen. My life is just inherently bad and always will be. It’s like having a friend who is really into a really bad yet insanely popular TV show and keeps insisting you watch it. You get to about season 2 and realize how much it actually sucks. You tell your friend about it, and he keeps insisting “Aww man you need to get to at least season 5 that’s when it really starts picking up.” No, this show is just objectively and inherently bad. I’m not going to stick around and push through this shit so I can get to stuff that is marginally more mature and self-actualized but still sucks. My life is like a bad yet popular TV show in the sense that it is inherently bad but keeps getting renewed for a new season.

I really don’t want to hurt anybody. I do think I’m generally a nice person, despite all of my bitterness and resentment of everything. I understand that the only reason I feel that way is because I feel this way about myself. I’m sure the world is a nice place but unfortunately I’m far too inadequate for it. A common saying is something like “you’re can’t change the cards you’ve been dealt, you just need to figure out how to play the hand.” I’ve never understood this saying. There are plenty of scenarios in a card game in which folding is your best option. I’ve been giving a whole handful of nothing and it’s probably best for me and everyone else if I just folded. If you are genuinely upset you’ve never going to see me again I’m sorry. I’m pretty sure most of you are going to act like you care and then forget about it in a week but I don’t really mind. I’m pretty resilient. I think that’s the only thing I’ve really had going for me this whole time is resilience. The fact of the matter is that this pain has now surpassed my resilience threshold.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"I'm pretty sure I don't actually want to commit suicide, but I wrote a suicide note to try to vent my frustrations.

And for as long as I can remember, it's still one shitty fucking birthday. Last year was pretty shitty. I lost my best friend, my job, had not a dime to my name and was suicidally depressed. This year I'm on medication and I'm trying to be happier, to move on and to make a better man out of myself and to just try to be.... better.

Of course life wants to bitch slap me in the fucking face. So far since waking up I've found out that the police have recovered my wallet that was stolen a week ago. The wallet that had every shred of ID in it. All the ID was torn to pieces and purposefully destroyed and stuffed back in the bill folds. So I found out that someone maliciously fucked with my shit. Great.

Then I went to the bank to check how little money I had. See if I could get something for my birthday. On the way someone picks my pocket and steals my new wallet. Only thing in there was my bank card, but still disheartening. I go into the bank, they gave me a ton of shit for having to get a new card as if it was my fucking fault that I've had my shit stolen.

I find out I've got $3. Cool. I go back to the homeless shelter I'm staying at and I get an email from family. $30 for my birthday! Sweet! I can get like a single can of beer, or a cupcake or just something to commemorate the fact it's my birthday. Not too much to ask I'd say. I deposit it only to find out in the fucking couple hours since I checked my bank account, they've taken out the monthly fees. There were other bank fees and yet another statement fee that they keep not reversing or taking off my account despite getting no statements. All in all? -$29. So I had about 68 cents to play with by the time it was all said and done.

I mean is it too much to ask for A FUCKING BREAK IN MY FUCKING LIFE? FOR ONE FUCKING DAY WHERE I CAN ACTUALLY SAY THAT IT'S FUCKING MINE AND I CAN ENJOY IT OR DO I HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH THIS FUCKING BULLSHIT FOR THE NEXT GODDAMN CENTURY?

 I headcanon Sirius Black as having BPD. Here is why: 

* Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
it’s difficult to say, but I do think he is scared of the Order (and Harry and Remus) deciding he’s not useful any more, which could lead to an abandonment

* A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation
he worships Dumblefore, then he hates him, then he loves him. He idealises James’ memory, he idealises Harry in the same way. He fights with Molly all the time and bickers with Hermione. He’s certainly volatile when it comes to friendships, enough that his friends could have believed him a spy. He hates Kreacher and refuses to be kind to him. he hates Snape and Malfoy.

* Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self
I mean. the man lived as a dog. He’s also torn between being the man he used to be, the handsome, strong, wild young man who taunted policeman, and the man he must become after Azkaban - quiet and housebound

* Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., substance abuse, binge eating, and reckless driving)
he is seen on the platform as Padfoot, which is impulsive and reckless. He breaks into Hogwarts in overdramatic ways which don’t help his cause.. I think he was drinking heavily during OotP but don't think I have any evidence for this

* Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior
difficult to say. certainly would be in keeping with his character. He starves himself when living off rats as Padfoot even when told he could “lie low at Lupin’s”, which could be seen as a somewhat passive form of self harm. his desperation for a fight could also be seen as a symptom of passive suicidal ideation

* Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)
he’s irritable and difficult at Christmas, then euphoric, then grumpy again. he is mercurial. 

* Chronic feelings of emptiness
certainly in Azkaban, but as we can’t be sure about his earlier life perhaps best to pass on this one

* Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)
yes, he almost punches Snape, he quarrels with almost every character in the book!

* Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms
he arguably dissociates during the fight in OotP in the room of mysteries when he calls Harry “James”

that’s at least five, which is enough for a diagnosis.

(I also posted this in SuicideWatch, but since I really kinda have the need to share this with people, I hope it is okey.)

my name is Fabian, I am 19 years and come from Germany.

I write this cause I need to get this out of my head and maybe need someone to hear it.
It is 20minutes after midnight and I can't sleep at all.
Since a while now, I have the feeling that I slide back into depression.

At age 14 I went to the doc because I wasn't able to handle my life anymore, I had a social phobia and depression (probably cause of that). After 2 years of therapy I was able to say ""I am happy again"". It was awesome.
I got a girlfriend for the first time after therapy and everything got better by the day.
My GF split up, it was hard, but with that experience I learned so much for my life, that I am very well able to handle it.

That is 3 years ago now. On Thursday I will turn 20 years old..it kinda hits me hard.
It's not like the thing with my ex still gets me..but thinking about my life just gets me.. When I tell people I'm 3 years single, it's funny and ""dude, get yourself out there again""
I kinda want to, but when I like girls, I have fears to get closer with them.. I don't know how to overcome that.. It's like I don't want a relationship anymore cause my life gets harder by the day.

Other points are how I got friends, but still have a hard time, to get friends close enough to talk about problems..and I need that a lot.

See, I am so far out of my social phobia, that I hate it when I'm alone, I love to be around people now.
I play in a metal band since a few months and it is freaking awesome.
But everytime I think about my life, I feel how I slip back into my depression.. I try to get a reason, but all the things with girls and stuff, I really dont think that this is my only problem.

Sometimes I just think, once you were dperessed, you will never get completely out of it.. that I will have to deal with it my entire life.

Yesterday I hit an all time low, I got completely wasted at a party, and from a nice little drink with happy thoughts, it went all down to myself wishing to end it again.
Since a while the thoughts of ending it are coming to my mind sometimes. I dont remember, but it seems like I talked about how ""shit my life is"" ""how I want to end it"" and threw my money away, my phone..
I don't know anymore.. my writing here is kinda confusing I imagine.
but I have to get this out..
how can my life go downhill like that? My life should be awesome!

There are more points, like, work is absolute bollocks right now..am at a job I hate because I have almost nothing to do all day.. apprenticeship will go on for 2 more years before I can switch..

but other than that, how can I be so sad all the time again? :(
When I'm home from work, I meet friends almost daily, it's fun.. but back at home, my thoughts get really messed up..

This disgusts me, I have recently lost a dear friend to sudden death and I should cherish the gift of life. I am sit pondering why I am thinking this, I guess it's escapism. A reason to disappear without it being my fault. Considering how selfish that is, it doesn't make me want it to not happen. Earlier I was sat at my laptop and I wrote an entire letter that should be read upon my death, I promptly deleted it. My lack of fear towards death is somewhat apparent to me now, so I delve into that thought. 

I've been feeling this way for several years now and never addressed it, I just went about my life daydreaming about death and the relief it would bring to me. It was never an issue for me, I was somewhat content with that way of thinking. Considering this, my life has changed drastically over the last year and I fell deeper into those dark thoughts. I was not just content with the idea of dying, I wanted it to happen by any means, even if I had to do it myself. Thankfully after re-awaking after a somewhat explosive incident, I wrote about my thoughts. I kept re-reading them, analysing myself and actions. 

Originally I thought I didn't fear death because I have nothing to lose, but if that was the case what would I need to escape from and why would I leave a letter? Upon re-reading this letter I addressed several people that I loved dearly and cited my apologies to various mistakes I have made over my life. That is what I fear, making more mistakes and hurting more people. 

I looked at past diary entries I put within a word document to track my thoughts, reading over these were difficult. The days in which I am down, It seems the whole article is a battlefield of emotions. I call myself worthless and selfish for wanting to be happy. That itself is somewhat a contradiction, being unhappy is ok and I should not put myself down for it. 

I am at a point now where I am learning to manage my emotions, this is still difficult and often I fall into the downwards spiral where I start to plead for death. If I truly wished upon death then I would not explore the subject of emotional intelligence, I want to accept my sadness, grasp it with both hands, not remove it but understand and learn from it. This will not only help me but those I love around me, my insecurities have all been created because of my own malicious intent to keep myself from being happy; this has effected my relationship with my partner and family.

What I am trying to explain here is that I have accepted my problem and I am working on it to make myself a better person, I am not looking for any straight fix or escape any more. I want to learn about myself, grow into a better person and partner. I have been diagnosed with depression for 4 years, it consumed me and I didn't even realise. I may of never realised without the support of my partner, who is suffering her own battle, but I have discovered love not only of my partner but my family and friends. 

I am in no disillusion that I am happy now but my anger and sadness is not 'just the way i am', it is a problem I need to address and I am going to do that, not only for me but those I love.

If you read this far, I am extremely grateful you took the time to read this. I don't really know what I am seeking to achieve, maybe I just want to share my journey or I just want to write my thoughts. If you have your own stories to share, I'd be delighted to hear.

I was drinking with my cousin (who I'm no longer on speaking terms with) and we arrived at a bar at 1am along with my cousin's friend. My cousin and I don't really get along all the time and we were both pretty drunk and he decides to leave me at 1am with his friend. Me, upset, decides to drink a whole pitcher of beer. (I had problems with drinking at this time). Anyways, I was absolutely trashed. It should be known that I am a very shy and introverted person, and I'm also gay. Anyways, I barely had control of my faculties and he decided to ""help"" me home. When we got home, we started kissing and under any other circumstances I would have said no. So I kind of tried to walk away, and he stopped. But then he started again and I could barely tell where I was and he started having sex with me. (No consent was given at this point). I got really freaked out and started crying which made him get off of me and I told him to get the fuck out.
Now, I don't know what to categorize this as. I have a lot of feelings of guilt about this because I was so drunk.

I've been severely depressed since i was around 14/15, and it has not gotten easier as i anticipated. But worse. Everything hurts. The smallest of things just sends me down this hill that almost always ends up with me writing fragments of a note. A suicide note.

Last month, i ended up finishing with the biggest exams of my school life (at least in this goddamn nation)...and i know i wont do well. Academics, were once something i was really good at uptill the 10th grade. Used to be a perfect all A's student, even topped the city. But couldn't cope with 11th and 12th...self harmed many times cause grades were the only thing. It was my self worth...my pride. But as the results come out soon, i sit here shaken t my core cause i know it wont be good.

On 4th April...11:57 PM. My elder brother, who was autistic...passed of a heart attack. Doctors said he was improving, that he was fine....doctors said he would be discharged soon. I...I don't think i have ever cried this much in the past month than i have in my life. The funeral rites, which i was chosen to do. The ashes...which i was chosen to immerse. The guilt of not being a good brother ever, thinking that he lived believing that i hated him. I really didn't. I never expressed it properly.... My sisters hated each other like sibling rivals but now they're in their 30's. I don't know. At one one point during this hellish month, i was so zoned out i used to fall asleep crying and wake up crying, with the concept of time &amp; reality dashed and divided into a million stars, like the ones i often stared at aimlessly.

Now that a month has settled...i feel numbed. And i just want to go. I'm not meant for the world and i'm not going to make it. I really don't think i will, nor do I want to. But after these events, the gravity has sunk in. I feel so terrible, and looking at how much pain mom and dad are in...and i now see the true impact my departure will have on them. They will cry. They will curse the universe. They will question with all their might why they lost both their sons in such a short period. 

But. I really cannot go on. I really cannot. After tons of ""Be strong!"" ""Be brave"" esque hollow messages, I've latched onto  a soothing thought: that he might be in a better place. The last months were really bad for him...he struggled so much.

But. I think it's also time for me to accept that perhaps i also may need to be in a better place. I can't cope with this. I really tried. I tried a lot. To force myself to be happy, to post on communities like Reddit to distract myself, etc. But mom dad, my dear sisters, and of course my lovely Dog and the 6 Goldfish (both who will never understand where their master went) I've grown to love : I'm sorry.

What do you guys feel when you miss doses.

Would love to hear from gaba users too

I ask because I am on gabapentin and I know that this med has a rediculously short life in me. 

Well I ran out yesterday at the right time (only get a weeks supply due to chronic overdosing) and my doc wouldn't refill my meds until today. 

Gabapentin doesn't seem to help with mood stabilization and since I've been on ever mood stabilizer, antipsychotic (atyp. Some typs)  and almost every antidepressant (all xxris, effexor, wellbutrin, tetras too) she is reluctant to try anything new.

BUT HOLY MOTHER OF PONIES AND GRYPHONS the crash! I was in absolute pain, no energy to move, vomiting, voices of friends laughing and leaving, hearing this screaming , panicking, and all around contemplating suicide. I have come so very close with this crash! And I don't know whether or not to attribute it to this med and missing a day.

Needless to say, I just forked over $80 for a WEEKS supply.

Since this will more than likely happen again. Does this kind of thing happen and is this from the meds? It doesn't help, but has a crash like that. I've cold turkeyed a lot of shit, but that... was... hell!

Bonus: what the hell do I do about that pricetag. I used up a whole half of all the money I have for the whole month (unemployed, uninsured, ineligible for disability apparently,  and previously homeless and soon to be again). I'll look for a coupon, but will it work for weekly doses?

I am going through a breakup as well. My girlfriend got back together with her ex boyfriend, without telling me, about three weeks ago. We were going to prom together and she thought that I would still want to go as her second date with her boyfriend. I really should have ended the friendship there, but I am pathetic and and I am still friends with her to this day.

However, I don't feel as if the breakup is influencing my desire to live in any way. We still talk daily, and have a great relationship because I forgave her. She has helped me through all of my self-harm, Tourette's Syndrome related problems, depression, anxiety, and she has even helped boost my shitty self-confidence. If anything, she is one of the only things keeping me from killing myself. Well, her, and my twin brother, who I know will be devastated if I die. I just love her so much and she may feel the same for me, but it is not enough for her to want to be with me.

I talked to my ex some more and she told me not to feel sorry about the problems I caused last night. The problem was that I decided that it would be a good idea to cut and to break my 35 day clean streak before I left to hang out with my friends. Because I was feeling so bad and I didn't want to ruin the night, as little pick-me-up, I decided to cut before I left. Well, I didn't know till right before we left that my ex was bringing her boyfriend. We're still friends but I am NOT over her and she didn't tell me he was coming. So, I went into the bathroom and cut through that same cut. 

Apparently, I cut deeper than I thought as, 3 hours later, I took my phone out of my pocket and it was covered in blood. I bled all the way through my jeans to the top and all of my friends saw. Only one said something and she took me to the side and we talked. 

I was so upset about projecting my problems onto others and, in effect, ruined their night. On top of that, all of my friends know that I cut now. I just feel so ashamed, pathetic, and embarrassed. Again, this is not the reason I am suicidal, it's just me needing to vent after a tough night. I'm suicidal because in the past year, I was probably only happy for three weeks. The rest of the time I have been miserable. I just don't know that it is worth it anymore. I'm starting to feel so bad that I almost don't care that my family will miss me. I just see it as my world will be over and that would be the end of that. I wouldn't have anything else to deal with.

Two of my mother's limbs are unable to function, which severely handicaps the activities we can do.

As is, I am heart broken to death; she was my only friend. It's not even a ""Only friend I can ask for"".. nothing even close to consider near ""comparing"" to ANYTHING. 

Her name is Kasey, and we met on Facebook; (We've gone through some *heavy* stuff which I wish not to get too into..) and soon after getting conformable, I decided to message her once more. ( First time was a simple conversation )

I managed to get her number, since she offered me the first week. Turns out, we both have the same area code.. meaning, we live in the same state!

Finally, it was rather a small, light-hearted relationship of when I asked her out. It was amazing, but small.. but the best decision of my life..

I can't type well, so I'll make it short.. Together, her and I promised to be soul mates forever, and only us. That promise was the most meaningful, strongest thing in the world I have done and meant. 

We broke up after 2 years, and it has been hell after problems of the relationship.. It was my fault for the break up, but me and her thought it was for the best. Weeks later, getting over it, she was in LOVE with me for months. Months and months, and wished for me to never go into another relationship again. I didn't.. but I did not accept her into my life. I wanted to later on in life..

She met a guy. She hung out with him every day. Her love slowly turned for him, and slowly I was fading to just a best friend. Which.. was horrifying, but I'll accept it.

Months later, my heart has not felt a beat since then. And still not.. Now, I couldn't handle it. It was too painful to watch her move on. I blocked her off of everything, it was too painful..

Half a year later, I message her. Explained the story, and hoped for a reply; and she was never so happy to see me again!

It struck. Her boyfriend and her were so strong in the relationship. I asked ""Are you going to be in that forever?"" She said yes, with complete smile on her face with the most confidence I've seen in my life. it sucked..

She slept over, and in 4 in the morning she can't stand to be away from him, so he skyped him.. just like she did with me.

We even slept on the same bed, she trusted me and loved me so much still.

Now, I tried to talk to her. She cut off ends from me. It was too depressing for me and her, and she has a new life. New future. Different Kasey.

I coughed up blood, and in the process I still feel shaking. Tasting blood, and enormous pain. I don't want a future of anything else in life. I don't want to do ANYTHING. I don't want to live on..

I'm going to explain what happened a little so I apologize if this is triggering.  In 2013, the end of my senior year of high school, all of my friends stopped talking to me because my best friend (who was on hard drugs at the time) started spreading rumors about me. I've asked, he doesn't know why. So that fall I go to college and I'm really hopeful in making new friends and I meet this guy and we end up dating a few months in. I was a virgin and he wasn't so we waited about 6 months until May.  At this point he is my only friend. A week after we have sex for the first time he rapes me. We had sex earlier in the night and I fell asleep. A while after he wakes me up because he is pulling me on top of him, I say no and climb off and tell him I'm too tired and I want to lie down.  He climbs on top and has sex with me anyways. I get up and get dressed and go back to bed and I feel really confused because I love him and I didn't fight it and let it happen. Another few months go by and in September he gets drunk one night. We start making out and I tell him I wish he wasn't so drunk because I wanted to have sex because we hadn't in a month.  He starts crying and convinces me isn't that drunk so we continue but he starts getting aggressive and I realize how he is too drunk and I tell him I'm not comfortable and he tells me to shut up and just fuck. I stay quiet and don't do anything because I'm scared and I don't want to be a bad girlfriend.  He continues to pressure me to have sex whenever we are alone until I break up with him that October 2014. 

Flash forward to February 2016. He starts dating someone new and my PTSD comes back with a vengeance and I feel guilty if she gets raped.  I tell her, she decides to stay with him.  Saying that it doesn't matter I was raped and that she doesn't think he is capable of it again. He ends up going to the mental hospital because he had plans to kill himself.  While he is there things get so bad for me so I tell mutual friends. They all show sympathy and his roommates ask him to move out.  Then they stop talking to me, inviting me over, any form of contact even when I try to talk to them.  My best friend send me to the hospital against my will because she is convinced I'm going to take pills and overdose.  I had to skip studying abroad in the summer to pay off medical bills.  I find out after that my best friend texted my rapist and told him that it wasn't his fault he raped me because it was a grey area since we were dating.  She also told his new girlfriend that she is glad they talked it out, but how can you talk out rape? We talked it out and he continued to rape me. I'm sorry I just got emotional there. 

Anyways I lost all my friends. No one talks to me anymore. I want to kill myself every waking moment of my life. My body isn't mine. I can't get aroused during sex. I tried to date someone new but it was too difficult emotionally and that was before my PTSD came back. 

My mom found out and she told me I'm an idiot for not reporting it when it happened.  That if he kills himself it's my fault.  She wants me to transfer schools or drop out or commute.  She wants me to quit my job there because I still have to deal with these people. I don't know what I did to deserve this treatment from all these people that were supposed to be my friends. 

I don't know what to do and I don't know if I should report it. If I report it he may kill himself and that will be my fault. I don't know how to make friends when I am too depressed to leave the house. I have no support. I need a friend and someone to be with me so I don't hurt myself and so I have someone along the way.  I feel like a burden. The few people I talk to I know only keep me around because I lost everything and everyone. I'm seeing a counselor but whenever I leave I just want to kill myself more.  It's worse if I go because I just get wrapped up in my brain and can't escape the hate I feel for myself. What do I do? How do I move on? I've been so unstable for months now and I'm giving up.

Yesterday, I went for a 2 mile jog, took 3 mg of Klonopin before I went to bed, and I still laid awake in bed until probably around 5 am. Then I can't wake up at all until 1 or 2 in the afternoon, which just makes me feel worse and like I've wasted another day.

And another thing, time feels like it's absolutely just flying by. I'll look at the clock one moment, do a few things for what feels like a couple minutes, and without realizing it, another couple hours will be gone.

Now, I'm trying not to drink every day, I'm trying not to drink at all actually to be honest, but when I go without, I think I begin to go through symptoms of withdrawal (recognized a lot of them after looking them up - insomnia, sweating, irritability etc.)

There have been days where I will break down just completely out of the blue into a sobbing mess and feeling like my life is ruined and I will never get better. I talked to my therapist (I've only had about 3 sessions with my new one) about it the other day, and it was kind of helpful to let it out, but after a couple hours the feeling just kind of faded. 

I really have no idea what to do anymore at this point. I can't get my symptoms under control. I can't cope anymore, because everything I used to use to cope, I associate with being a coping mechanism, and now that my emotions feel completely dull, it hurts to try to do something I know I would normally enjoy but feel nothing for now (i.e., essentially everything.)

 so. I've been drinking, steadily and slowly, since about 2pm. I'm drunk but not nearly enough - not drunk enough to forget, just to be hideously open with strangers on the internet. and to be typing at a glacial pace. 
 
 but I'm sobering up now. Been self harming for ten years and stopped for a month or so, and now - without any good reason to  - I want to start again. I already have bad scars. How much worse can my arms look? I also want to die, but that's just background noise. I have no idea what it's like not to want to die, so that doesn't really matter. 

 I feel incredibly isolated from everyone around me. My eating is erratic. I haven't spoken to anyone face to face in about a week. Nobody responds to my messages in the group chat, people don't want to talk to me. I am a student and all of my housemates sat me down in November and told me they couldn't live with me any more because I Was too difficult. All I had been doing was spending time in my room, but apparently quiet people are hell to live with! Who knew! 
 That was my third suicide attempt, that night. I ended up in hospital but only overnight. Clearly even the NHS thinks I'm not worth getting upset about. I've got an appointment with a psychiatrist in June (I was referred by my GP in January) and I am very scared. 
  
 I suppose this post is here because I'm sick of writing in my shitty diary. All it is is self loathing and bloodstains and vague suicide plans. I took forty paracetemol and was told I hadn't been serious about suicide, and since then it all seems so rubbish. I'm not going to lectures/seminars, I hate my degree, and most of all I hate the people I live with. 

 I think I'm so upset because it was one girl's birthday today. She is a psychology student who looks upon me as an interesting case study and not really as a human. Everybody in the house posted really nice messages on her Facebook wall, and nobody bothered to do that for my birthday. I know this is childish and silly, but this is how they've always made me feel. And then they told me they couldn't live with me! And that hurt me so much. I isolate myself so much now becuse there's no point in trying to talk to people. 

 I feel like I should  never have been born. Not that I want to die, right now, but I aim to hurt myself fairly badly. I won't go for stitches because of the awful treatment I got last time I had to go. Last time I was in hospital for stitches I was begging the doctor to put me in hospital, but they refused. 

 I don't know what to do. I don't know who I am any more. All I do is complain and complain and cry and cut. I used to be such a happy kid! I had so much going for me, and now all I have is the black hole that is my future.

The story goes back to my friend offering me a part in an independent movie. I decided to take the role. We were filming one day and I met a girl there. I was flat out in love at first sight. Best part? She was playing my wife in the movie. So here I am, oogling over this girl. Few smoke breaks pass by and I find out she's taken. But she offers to go see a movie with me that weekend because we had made pretty good friends. I was a virgin at the time and the juices were flowing pretty well. The movie went great, we cuddled together and held hands. All that jazz. Eventually we start seeing each other more, we have sex many times. Continue to have a good relationship for a few months. I'm head over heels in love with this girl. She says she loves me too. She was first to say it actually. Flash back to recently. She started wanting to see me less. I knew what was coming. That she wanted to stay with her boyfriend. She told me this and I accepted it at the time but then one day he breaks up with her for some reason. She comes over and we hang out, make love and watch tv. She says we can start seeing each other again but more this time because she's single. The next fucking day thus douchebag says he regrets breaking up with her and she goes right back to him. Tells me she wants to give him one more chance. Even if they break up again she tells me she doesn't want to be with me. Last night, her and I sit in her car until the early morning and just talk. If I could make that car ride last forever, I would have. She tells me she really thinks he changed and that I just need to move on. I cry for a little with her there. She hugs me, tells me she loves me and then leaves. I am lost in my life without her. It sounds overly dramatic and I've heard the spiel of plenty of fish in the sea but I cannot imagine a more perfect woman to be with. I adore this woman so much. I've always been kind of alone. Friends tend to come and go. I've lost interest in my old hobbies. I'm in debt roughly $6,000 and I make a little over minimum wage. My parents do whatever they can to piss me off because I know they want me to move out but I can't afford it.

So I'm 16, I hate my appearance and my socially inept mind. I struggle with all conversation par maybe 3 people. I never liked asking for stuff at all, I feared the possibility of rejection (not just ordering food but with my family too, asking my mum if i was allowed to do something or if she could get me something, I would put it off for hours until either I finally asked or just didn't bother). I can't leave my house because of my crippling social anxiety and trying to talk online always ends within maybe 15 minutes (I never know what to say or how to start/where to end a conversation). Whenever I talk to people I feel useless, trapped within my lack of social judgement, I end up just getting left on ""seen"" and then I just give up. I had a girlfriend once, she was constantly talking to other guys and I felt like a 2nd choice to her a lot of the time. She broke up with me abruptly after 7 months and within a week had moved to another city and moved in with one of the guys she was talking too during our relationship. I dropped out of school when I was 14 and a half, the social anxiety alongside severe clinical depression had me breaking down almost daily. At a very young age I started withdrawing from emotion until just under 2 years ago I became numb entirely, nothing effects my numb state of emotion. I started to self harm maybe 3 months ago and it's nice, I can feel pain and it's soothing. I dream about suicide a lot of nights and have OD'd twice, once on anti-depressants and once on sleeping pills. I think if slitting my wrists every time I cut and I'm annoyed that I haven't yet, I don't know what the fuck is stopping me but it just makes me hate myself more.

He would rape me and stroke my penis at the same time. After that i started to fantasise about him, I masturbated thinking of him. The first time, and a few other times he raped me, he would push me into a pillow so I couldn't breathe, or put his hands around my neck and suffocate me.

I'm really in a bad place and I hate how I feel about my college life. I have been in school for almost 3 years now and I have not even been able to take the classes normal student should take at their second semester.

The semester after I was dismissed was very good. It was the first time I got an A in college. The following semester was alright but managed to pass most of my classes and maintain a GPA above 2. The past semester (Spring 2016) I was determined to put in the work and get good grades, but at the beginning of the year I have been thinking a lot about my situation and how I was ""late"" in terms of classes and how I would never be able to catch up (considering this is my third year in college) so I've lost motivation to work and study. My weeks go as follow, skip classes and drink on the weekend. Every weekend I was drinking and partying just to forget how my messy life is. The thing is i was feeling bad about it around Monday but I couldn't just stop. I start drinking on Thursday night and not stop until it's Sunday morning. I've failed all my classes because I was really depressed and wasn't able to work. I'm pretty sure I will get dismissed again but I don't know if I want to continue again. I feel like if I had a fresh start I will be able to fix everything but now It's really unfixable, and that depresses me. I went to see a therapist last October and he told me that I could be depressed and suggest that I take medication. The idea of taking pills for depression scared me so much so I stopped going. I feel really bad about everything. I've had some serious suicidal thoughts but never act. No one knows about this and and I have no idea who to talk to. What bothers me the most is the fact that I'm growing old and yet never actually did anything useful with my life in the last five or six years.

I can't describe my feelings any better than simply that. A simple discussion went south so fast and now I'm cemented to my bed. I think of getting up, of walking anywhere in my house and a wave of pure exhaustion sweeps over me. I'm not tired...not physically but mentally I am. 

This all started last night. A friend of mine is in a really bad place and harboring an obsession with finding a girlfriend. Usually that doesnt bother me but last night he wanted me to hook him up with a sjngle friend of mine. I refused, I told him that I couldn't, in good conscious, set them up because of her daily habits. He became irrationally angry with me and we sat in silence until I decided to hang up the call. From there I was feeling really strange and the self blame began. That blame persisted for the rest of the evening.

After I hung up with him I called my girlfriend. We spoke for a while and I started to feel better and after about an hour I went to bed. Fastforward to when I woke this morning. 

I didn't feel right. I wasn't happy and it's just been a day where nothing goes right. I cant find interest in anything. Now jump to two hours ago and everything gets worse. I spoke to my girlfriend when she woke up and as she got ready for work. Everything was fine and normal until she inquired about a jobs pay that I'm starting in a week. We ended up in a huge argument and when I went to a friend of mine to discuss the situation with him even more went wrong.

I have a long history of problems, both mentally and physically and today, all of them have just flared into my thoughts and crippled me. It's really amazing how a simple argument with your girlfriend can suddenly cause you to relive horrible occurences, to question your choices in life and worst of all, question if there's any reason for you to be alive.

For the record, I'm a woman and my girlfriend is not abusive in any way. The argument was purely over how my mother treats me and she's right, it isnt right but due to circumstances with my health I have no choice. In the end, however, I can't help but feel I deserve to be treated the way I am and that it's my fault. That everything is my fault...",depression,t5_2qqqf,It's near 5 in the afternoon and I've been in bed for nearly 16 hours...

7 Years Sleep

My eyes are charred and my soul is scarred

Too weak to wake or wonder

My vision's dazed and my skin is aged

I can barely breathe, my path's been seized

I can hear only aching thunder

The raging rain brands my brain

But visions of rainbows lull me under

From a world of walls and empty halls

To a placid place of silent ventures

From the graceless void, I'm briefly buoyed

By my black and blank adventures

My days were plain and stained with pain

My windows held no Sun

The cluttering clouds spoke aloud

The seasons spiked and spun

But to escape into that bottomless lake

Where darkness shines and shimmers

To scan the icy scars between the bars

And find they're thawed and thinner

Seven solid years, my soul endeared

To soil its stolid essence

Nights and days drawn from a daze

Binding every lustful sense

Been in this anxiety episode for ~5 weeks. I'm type2, so if this is mania, it's my first time.

This episode:

1.  Little to no depression ( I'm often depressed ).

2. Lots of anxiety:

      2a.  Randomly see room shrink out of corner of eyes

      2b.  I lock self in personal office room. Feel people are planning to knock in door and attack ( not super strong most days )

      2c.  Twitchy hands, like clicking fingers together rapidly ( worst at night ).

Big problem is anxiety can switch to rage/verbal attack in an instant. Hasn't become physical yet, but close.

EX: I feel people want to break into my office room, and attack me. So, my inner thought tells me to run out and attack first.

Daily drugs:

1.  Dexedrine - started 2 weeks

2.  Lamotrigine - taken 1+ years

3.  Lexapro - taken off and on 2+ years; so far consistently taken it for last 4-6 months.

While Dexedrine works, it treats my anxiety better than Klonopin. I know - it's weird - I don't understand it. When Dexedrine starts wearing off, and anxiety starts getting stronger, I immediately take Klonopin - usually only needed during workdays, due to lots of extra anxiety at work office.

By bedtime, if I'm a wreck, I have to take 1/2mg Xanax and 100mg Trazodone to sleep. 

Trying to get accommodation from HR to work from home. I think they're dragging their feet, so I bug them everyday. This request actually started in February - I didn't know these things would take so long.

The operator was really nice. I told her the issue, and she said they were 'streamlining' the referral service, and that I wasn't the first to have this issue. I think I felt her rolling her eyes over the phone, as if she was frustrated by the referral service like me. 

So she gave me the direct line to the referral person. The referral person sounded professional. I told her I was referred to a Christian counseling service, and that I would prefer to just go to a non-religious therapist. 

She told me they send everyone either there, or a different Christian based program. She said she couldn't think of any non-religious ones, but that I could just find whoever I wanted to see on my own and they would do the referral. But then she remembered one and gave me the name of the place to look up. 

I looked them up, and they seem fine. So I called back and I'll now be seeing them.

But I'm still disappointed. I didn't ask for the referral because insurance requires it. I was asking my doctor to help me find a good therapist because I've had trouble finding any worth the copay in this area. I had explained this to them in the hopes that it would be better than just randomly picking names off my insurance provider directory. 

But it's not. It now appears that I'm back to just going to a random therapist, not tailored to my needs at all (other than being secular). 

It's just so frustrating finding a good therapist. Other than the Psychology Today listings, there is almost no information available to you about therapists. And most therapists aren't on that listing, and the ones who are don't necessarily take the insurance you have. Most therapists here don't even have a website. This place does, but it doesn't give any of the therapists' names, and doesn't say anything about what the therapy is like - doesn't say if they do CBT or DBT or *anything* about their techniques. I don't know who I'll be seeing there, if they will be a psychologist or a social worker or a licensed counselor. I don't know *anything* about them. They don't have any reviews on healthgrades.com or anywhere else. It's just another shot in the dark.

So I'm taking another shot in the dark. 

It just irritates me that it's so difficult to shop for mental health services. I've had therapists who were good, and I've had therapists who weren't even worth the visit. But as a patient, almost your only option is to just pick random names and try them.

They all have no idea what's inside my head. Not even my best friends know what my mind is going trough. And I ain't telling. What for? If I do go into detail and tell them everything; all my feelings; how exactly I feel; What then? How exactly are they be able to help me? In no way.

But not, because I'm too strong to openly show my emotions; it's because I'm too weak to do it. It's become the natural state of mine to keep a poker face. I fake some positive emotions to keep people from asking what's wrong and that's it. And even to the people I'm most open to, I haven't told everything. They know I feel bad, they know I'm suicidal, they've pulled me off from the train tracks once... But they don't know really **how** bad I feel. And I'm scared to tell them. You can say that I don't trust people... The one person I would bet my life on, I would give my life for and would do anything for, I haven't told him the full extend of my feelings. Probably never will. And no ""Suck it up, bro."", ""Go do something."", ""Get some motivation."" don't make me better. I know they want to help me. I know they can't find an actual way to help me. It's that my patience has gotten down to **zero** in the last two months. I was able to get trough everything and not bat an eye. I could have the whole world collapse around me, while ten people screech with styrofoam and not care the slightest. Now the second someone says or does something stupid I want to kill them.

I usually stay inside my home for days, months without even barely talking to anyone. So, I usually spend my days reading or watching TV. I am sort of a nerd and because of how TV shows are portraying today that the entire human race is nothing more than narcissisitc, maniupaltive, selfish bastards ... that makes me afraid even more.

I know, I know, all of this is clearly made for entertainment purposes so most of them are clearly fake, but ... I am well aware of the world is made of. 

I read a lot of history and you will be very shocked of what people did, or I read plenty of the news and you will be surprised of how much plenty of people in charge lie at our faces.

And yes, I know, the media or plenty of newscasts want to shove at our faces, making us feel like we are living in a world with an inevitable doom (probably for the sake of an agenda or for the sake of profit like FOX News constantly does)

But ....

I still cannot shake this feeling, that terrifying fear like I am sounded by a race that wants to do nothing but harm me. I feel vulnerable. Even when I talk to people, I keep shoving that fear at the big of my head, yet, I cannot get rid of it, making me think twice after talking to anyone, making sure whether or not they are plotting against me, or stir a rumor until it goes on the internet and everyone believes it. Or everytime I am online or posting something on the internet, I feel like I am exposing myself

Given the fact because of what happened to me + my poor social skills + my isolation from almost the entire world, I feel like ... I don't know, like I am stuck in a horror movie, or like I am stuck in a filthy world where all humans are nothing more but cruel bastards, kinda like the Game of Thrones, just to give an example.

Yes, I know, the world is clearly not as bad as the media likes us to believe, but don't tell me that I am not right. Humans are not the best race in the world and we do a lot of disturbing or terrifying shit. It is almost like being a selfish asshole is in our genes and I feel like I am surrounded by them and cannot feel safe.

Almost feels like I am caught in a zombie apocalypse, only the infected are the human race (just to give another example). Yes, I know, it sounds pretty paranoid and delusional but I cannot just shake off this feeling",ptsd,t5_2qm0x,I feel like I am swimming in a world of sharks

I smelled smoke but the oven wasn't on. She gets this way when she gets her smorgasbord of meds, like xanax, ambien, pain meds refilled, around the same time each month. So about a week per month she turns into a completely different person; mean, incoherent, confused, clumsy, dangerous. She started a fire with that oven last year. I should have called someone earlier and I had plenty of opportunities, but she said she would change. And selfishly, I knew she would kick me out if I called someone on her. I am fucked if she kicks me out since I actually did call someone. 

The ambulance came and they could tell she was on something, so they took her to the hospital. The ambulance sat in the driveway for a long time, which was strange, and in my mind, I knew she might say something like I hit her or something. She said she fell earlier today which I don't know if true or not. She has fallen before while under these meds and went to the hospital. I called and spoke to the nurse then and told her all the things she does when she gets her meds. I don't think they checked her for meds because sure as shit, she is still getting the same medications now. 

Well, a cop stopped by and we spoke and he said my mom made some allegations against me. As I said, I kinda knew it. Maybe the ambulance was going to wait for the cop to get there so my mom could talk to him? But the ambulance eventually left and about 20 mins later the cop came by. 

He was nice and I tried to explain everything. I mentioned she would get on her pill binges and then run out and ACCUSE ME of stealing them and threaten to call the cops! Yes, there was yelling because, as shameful as it is, I lost my temper with her because I can't deal with her when she's like this. I can't deal with anything anymore considering the year I've had. We do yell, but never would I hit her, although I would like to. That sounds bad, I know. But it's what I think, not what I would do. NEVER would I actually hit anyone like that! I've never been in a fight (except for what would be a slight slapping exchange in middle school that was the most pathetic excuse for a fight ever) or any kind of trouble with the law. I am an internally depressed person, which means I would hurt myself, not anyone, if it came to that. 

But I am an adult living at his mother's recently, who doesn't have a job or car or money or anything but a cat. So I am not exactly A-class citizen material. I was unsure about whether or not I might be going to jail tonight for something I didn't do. 

As I said, the cop was nice. We talked for a bit and I hesitantly brought up the allegations since I thought that was why he was there. He just shook his notepad at me dismissively, and said he has to look into any allegations. So he left after getting my info. Phone's rung a few times since, restricted call, but when I answer it hangs up. 

I am still not over a best friend's suicide from last month. And now this shit with my mom. No doubt I'll  be homeless when she gets back from the hospital and evicts me because I called the ambulance on her.

So intimate, and deep and hard and soft. I have my eyes closed. Im scared to look at you. I want to see my fathers face, his smile, his warmth. You wrap your big hand around my neck and tell me how much of a good girl I am...

Is this what it feels like to be called a good girl? It feels so bliss and euphoric and I smile. And you finish. And he's gone again. And I'm left empty but I don't show it.

My dad would've loved to play video games with me. Would've loved for me to cook for him. Rub his back and shampoo his hair. I do this for a lot of men. It gives me that ""how it could've been?"" feeling. And then you leave and that feeling is gone again.

for context, until very recently i lived my life very loudly. i was as close to being proud of my depression as i imagine one might be, in that i brought it up readily and told my family all about it in its ups and downs. i did all of this because i figured as long as i gave everyone as much information as possible, it would somehow hurt less when i chose to finally end my life. 

then i started getting into fights with friends of mine on the topic. some of them said that my words felt like threats because i told them there was nothing to do, so i made them feel helpless. some of them told me they simply didn't have anything to offer, because i was such a contrarian on the issue. i think both of those are valid, so i just stopped talking to my friends about it, but since so many daily topics engage my suicidal thoughts it was usually easiest to just stop talking to those friends entirely.

therapy had to go too, because i'd been at it again for over a year and a half. i like my therapist; she's a lovely woman. but she works an hour away from me, it costs a bunch, and at the end of the day i'm pretty sold on suicide so i don't think i'm going to change anytime soon. i stopped seeing her a month ago, after one last session with my sister.

now i have to shut my sister out. i love her so much, and it felt so good to be honest with her always. but it will never make it hurt less, and in the meantime my words only make her worry. so now i don't talk to anyone.

it's starting to hurt again. it's been so long that i'd actually forgotten what physical depression feels like. i'm nauseous and exhausted and so cold. i feel weak, like i'm actually dying. i want to talk to someone so much, but i'm so tired of being met with this abhorrent disdain.

About me: I am a depressed 15 yearold boy with some kind of Asperger Syndrom... I am kinda hyperintelligent 'n stuff, which I am not very happy about considering the combination...

So the story is about me and a girl... The girl that fucked up my whole life and turned me into month-lasting depression. It all started when we had some kind of a trip with our whole grade for 4 days. We had much free time and at the first day, a friend of mine knocked at the wrong door, where a clique of 4 girls had their room. Y'know he said they semt pretty cool, so we just went there to hang out during free time and it was just fun. Me and my friends, we have never been the 'coolest kids' at school, if you know what I mean. And they hadn't been either. But they didn't care, they were crazy and cool. However one of the girls, her name's Julia, she was always the most quiet, she semt shy, but everytime i talked to her, I was simply amazed by her view on things, by her character, all in all by her. To be fair, she looks pretty gorgeous too, although that was never the fact I like her like I do. We got along quite well I guess at that trip... talked a lot... and what is there to say... I really fell in love like never before.
After the trip it just went on like that, we texted a lot for my proportions and even started to met. I just felt that we were soo similar in our way of thinking, we were different than all the others. I would consider myself as from the wrong planet, same with her. However some day, when we met I started to talk... stuff like love and how i could consider more... details don't matter. Just the fact that she refuses it... Of course it felt bad, but I could live with that... I just love her that much, that I enjoy every second I can spend with her, even if she does not feel what I feel.

But from then on, shit just got real... She started to block me, creating distance, she didnt answer my text messages, just completely cut me out of her life. And y'know that shit feels terrible, because it literally was like that for 8 months. I tried to talk to her like seriously... I still wanted her as a friend! But it all didnt matter to her. I just felt alone man...But nevertheless I still enjoyed every single word I spoke to her, but on the other hand it simply hurt deep down in my heart. That really put me in what I would call a depression... I wasnt motivated to live anymore. I just got drunk at every party I went to (here in Germany, soft Alcohol is allowed at the age of 16, so this isnt really a big deal) just to get her off my mind for that particular moment. In the end of course it got even worse... I am drowning in the thought of her. Just one single sign that led me thing about her,it didnt even have to be related to her, could bring me down for days...

The key event now, because I am writing apparently just happened, like an hour ago... The last two or three weeks, we got into more conversations again, we are in the same clique. So my dumbass self thought ""Hey why don't you text her? Maybe we can now be friends again"" She was all surprised why I write her and I told her, that maybe we could meet again, have fun, without anything more... She does not like me, does not want that, she said ""There was never even friendship from my side"" I opened my heart and that was all that came back... wow, I really dont know how describe my feelings now... Is that really it? Is it all over?
 Feel free to comment, i wanna talk... i will probably stay up the whole night after that shit... Also sorry for any mistakes, as said I am German and my English isn't that good...",depression,t5_2qqqf,My story of sadness

Until recently, I thought my only major mental health problem was OCD (I've had the Pure O variety, on and off, for years). During my latest bout with OCD, though, I've also developed depression, and I'm starting to take stock of just how screwed up my mental health has been over the years. The only time I was even vaguely normal and happy was as a child, but even then I was hypersensitive, especially to criticism. Since then, it's all been downhill:

- I developed OCD when I was about 14
- Had a brush with an eating disorder when I was 16 (I never thought I was fat per se, but I was really fixated on losing fat in one particular area and restricted my diet accordingly--when someone pointed out how much weight I had lost, I got scared and snapped out of it)
- Had a minor bout of depression when I was 16.
- Developed social anxiety sometime during my teens.
- OCD came back when I was 20, had another bout of slightly less mild depression.
- OCD came back again when I was 26 (about a year ago), and am having my first bout of moderate/severe depression.

I just...don't know how much more I can take. When I felt like OCD was my only real ""problem,"" I could sort of bracket it off in my mind, but now I'm beginning to see how systemic my tendency toward mental illness is, and I'm just in despair. Even in periods when I've been relatively functional, there have been issues that never really went away, like the social anxiety and hypersensitivity. I can't bear to think that I might have more problems that haven't manifested/been discovered yet (one of my OCD themes is that I have a personality disorder or an autism spectrum disorder, both of which are apparently common in people with eating disorders). 

I'm not suicidal at the moment; I was having thoughts a few weeks ago, particularly after starting a new SSRI, but my mood has stabilized a bit since then. I'm still depressed, though, just not in as much acute pain; I feel number now, but still can't see any hope for the future. To top it all off, I'm starting to suspect that I actually have ""atypical"" depression (onset in teens, reactive mood, hypersensitivity, extreme fatigue, etc.), which I've heard is more difficult to treat? I just can't shake the feeling that there's no point in someone with all my issues being alive, and I could really use someone to talk to.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Just realized I've never been normal and feel doomed

I’ve been thinking about it and putting it off for years now, but I think it’s finally time. I’ve never been a very happy person. Most of my life has been a cluserfuck of a disaster. I go from one tragedy to the next. I finally thought I was getting out, I moved away from my home town, I went to grad school in a totally new place. And I hate myself and my life even more. I was never a thin person but I’ve gained 40 pounds in two years because of stress and depression. I just checked my phone. Nobody has sent me personally a text in a week except for my mom whining about how I need to send her money. I have a few “friends” who don’t live in town, but they almost never text me unless I text them. They all have girlfriends and a life I guess. The only calls I have are from my landlord and from spam callers. 

I’ve tried so hard to make friends over the past few years. I made two. They both moved away. I’m a 26 year old fat virgin male. I know I’m not creepy, or a neckbeard. I’ve been friends with women in the past. But never romantically. No-one has ever been interested. And no I don’t just say that, I’ll ask people on a date or out to the movies or something that they could do if they wanted, but isn’t a big deal. They always say no. I’ve been on two dates my entire life. I’ve never been wanted. Nobody has ever held me. 

I think why I want to die is because I’ve never been loved. I hate my family, I was beaten, watched my mother beaten, watched them ruin me, tell me how horrible I was. I was raised to believe there is something wrong with me and it still hurts my soul. I tried to love at churches I attended. I never felt it back. I’ve never had a really close friend. I’ll tell so called “friends” how depressed I am and how I’m worried to be left alone and they go “sorry I have plans this whole weekend I can’t hang out”. I try to make it work. I can make people laugh. I know I do. But I just feel like shit the whole time. I’ve never had anyone here for me. I’ve never been wanted. Even my own graduate program doesn’t want me anymore. 

I’ve given myself the summer. I have work obligations. Come September, once my lease runs out, once I don’t have anywhere else to go, once all my obligations are gone. I might do it. I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t know where else to go. I’ve failed at everything in life. I’m barely employable. I’m barely surviving. I’m lonely. I have money problems. I’ve tried so hard to make my life better and I don’t think I can anymore. I think this is the most rational decision.  I thought writing about this was supposed to make you feel better. Now I’m just more sure it’s the right decision.

I wish I could try the new meds, but I can't keep it up for 2-3 weeks. It hurts so much. I have no idea how I still keep going, but I do and it hurts even more, mentally and physically. Most of the things I do lost meaning, except for drawing, but you can't stay home forever only drawing, sadly. (Stayed home most of the week so I don't die) I can't cope anymore, cutting again, and there are upcoming oral exams and I'm afraid I'll get a full blown breakdown. I'm really confused, I don't know what I am expecting through posting this. There are no means left for anything and I think I finally made my decision. I only kept going because there was a meeting with a therapist last tuesday and I thought it'll fix everything. How overly optimistic and naive. Welp, I'll sleep now and go to school tomorrow again. You may leave some suggestions or something, already hurting thinking of tomorrow.

Best of luck to everybody out there and thanks for listening, I guess?",depression,t5_2qqqf,Really confused and anxious right now.

My fiance is the best thing that has happened to me. He's been supporting me for about 4 years now. He has a career and owns this condo and is all all-around amazing person.

He agreed to financially support me so I could go to university, so I did until halfway through last semester.

I have a learning disability and I thought I could beat it to have a better life. turns out I can't. Rather, it turns out others won't let me even try to overcome it. I can't finish my degree without starting all over... Another 4 years just to get an art degree (the only one I would be allowed to get) and another $60k+ down the drain.

I've already had to give up my dream career field with animals, so I've been busting my ass to get into something more lucrative, though not what I want to really do. It's fine, though. I can still have a great life, I can still volunteer and work with animals that way, plus I'll have more money.

I was led to believe by several people that it would be easy as long as I followed their steps. I trusted them like a fucking idiot. I was led to believe they were going to help me. I did everything I could, and I'll keep doing everything I can, but its getting me nowhere, and these people are mostly acting like they are surprised at my lack of success or like they didn't actually involve themselves in the first place. like maybe i wasn't going to follow through, and caught them off-guard when I did.

I quit my retail job because I had a real lead on this career field, just for them to renege and for me to be left without anything. My fiance says it's fine and he has been financially supporting me again, but I can't help but feel like I'm letting him down. He's the only person who has ever treated me well. He's the only person who has been supportive of me in my life, and I'm fucking it up.

I'm networking and doing all this shit, and applying everywhere and putting myself through certification programs and working with the state etc etc. Nothing is coming of it all. I'm willing to do literally anything just to get a paycheck and suddenly it seems like I'm unemployable.

I just want to do my part in this relationship. I just want to be allowed to be a person with a real career. I'm losing all of my dreams and everything is getting away from me and I feel like a goddamn moron for trusting people.

I've started to grow hateful toward everyone, which is uncharacteristic of me. I already have a weird case of OCD with a mix of symptoms, ranging from dermatillomania to intrusive thoughts, and they are in explosive full-blown mode now. I can't help but think of how jealous I am of people who die because at least they don't have to deal with this shit. I can't help but think of how I wish other people would die just so I could have a chance to succeed. I can't help but think that if I was dead, my fiance would be better off.

The dermatillomania is making me feel horrifically ugly, which is just compounded by the weight fluctuations of starving and binge-eating. My fiance also hasn't touched me hardly at all for about 2 years, so that doesn't help, but is it's own bag of shit.

I cry all the time and my binge-eating and starving are getting really out of control. I feel like I don't deserve to eat, and then when my self-loathing goes into a lull I try to make up for it by eating like crazy so I can try to think straight and get work done. 

Some days I frantically work myself to death, and others I just lay in bed and cry for hours. Then I feel bad about feeling so bad, because my fiance is working his ass off and I feel like he has more reason to have bad days. I feel like if I do anything less than be the perfect SO, I'm making him feel worse and I'm an asshole for it.

I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm a piece of shit.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm starting to really hate myself.

Their softness seems weak and needy. I dislike it very much. But it really comes from hating myself (thus I can't take people loving me seriously). I don't like the sun (very sensitive skin) and summer sucks. It's just too much I'm missing. I'm not like people around me. All in all,  I'm not interesting (although I can pretend).

It seems that we have gotten so used to saying the word ""depression"" so much, that is has somehow become normalised in our culture, or maybe every culture. It's like saying the word ""depression"" is normal now and people often downplay it as nothing that serious. Almost like feeling depressed is something not as serious like a common cold.

And now, because we so used to saying the word ""depression"" over and over again, people often downplay it as ""feeling low"".

Seriously, why can't people just fucking learn that depression is not simple as ""feeling low""? Why can't people learn that my period of ""feeling low"" is a lot more personal and even distressing as feeling like you are walking in an empty shell?

Still stuck in it, and slowly worsening. But, it's still only mixed hypomania, thank God!

This mixed episode gave me something I've never felt before - social anxiety. I am normally a joking, center of attention, never serious, nonchalant guy.

My anxiety easily triggers violent thoughts and compulsions. It can get really difficult to control.

*** 1st request to HR in Feb ***

Pdoc wrote a request for me to work from home, due anxiety working at office. 

I'm still too afraid to tell pdoc my anxiety is triggering violence, because I don't know what she will do. 

HR ( I'm only working with the head HR of our company ) denied my Feb request. Instead, she chose a private office room for me. I've tried making it work for 2 months, but it's not. 

Daily work-life example:  my mind thinks ""My coworkers are going to break down the door to my private office room, so I need to go out and attack first.""

*** 2nd request to HR in April ***

So, in early April, I told HR office room wasn't working. Please let me try working from home.

BTW - YOU GUYS SAVED MY ASS EARLIER - THANK YOU SO MUCH!

I was going to tell HR my anxiety triggered violent thoughts towards coworkers.  I asked this subreddit, and you said telling HR about violent thoughts would get me fired ASAP. Thanks, again, for saving me. 

***My current status ***

This week, I was done being nice, since HR was just dragging this out - it was def low priority to HR. 

I emailed HR Thursday night - I told her I've read ADA/EEOC extensively, listed key points, and how she was violating my rights. 

HR emailed me back the next day, before work even started. She told me the final step: the attached document needs to go to my my pdoc.  She has to read it, then write a response. HR will then review, and make a final decision. 

I see my pdoc this Tuesday. Like I said, she doesn't know the violent side to my anxiety. I'm thinking about telling her, though.

If I do, and she responds to HR, stating ""let my patient work from home, due to the violent anxiety of his disability"" ... would that letter allow HR to fire me on the spot?

Does anyone know, 100%, that HR can or can't fire me?

Or, does anyone know an EEOC specialist I can pay for a phone consult Tuesday morning, before my pdoc appointment?

SIDE QUESTION: if my pdoc decides to stop prescribing my ADHD amphetamines ( Dexedrine is amazing for my anxiety btw ), and so I go to a new pdoc, would the new pdoc somehow find out about what the previous pdoc did, and also not prescribe it?",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,Mixed episode - anxiety violence.

They're not going to make me happy long term, I already know that from experience.

The problem is that I feel incomplete my whole life, like I am searching for something I can't find and like I don't belong here.

I know it sounds like the most overused chliche phrase ever but since I am a child I am staring into the distance occasionally, wondering why I am even here. It feels like sometimes, or most times even, the world loses dimension and like something essential is missing. Everything is so super bland and boring, so pointless.

At times this pointlessness seems like an eternal black void that overlays simply everything and robs everything of any meaning it could have ever had.

Hard to explain. Suddenly the world is gray and flat. Like in one of those dreams where you can't walk anymore because your hips hurt in a weird way and it feels like you're walking through 1-m high wet sand.

What scares me is that sometimes I seem to jump from one extreme where everything seems justified and colorful and full of meaning to that bland space in 1 second. It's like turning from a child suddenly to a 80yr old that is weak and tired of life. What causes the shifts I don't even know.

Six months before I had to be out of my old apartment back east, I knew I had to move or be homeless again. One shelter experience with my son and his needs was enough for me, I'm never doing it again.

Facebook is irritating me with it's ""On This Day"" app, because it's always showing pictures and posts from times that I thought sure I was on the right track, only to end up knee deep in shit again. 

I moved 2700 miles from home, to get away from a lot. I ended up being used by someone who just wanted to make sure he could continue to stay where he was, while his father was sick. That man (the father) was the only one who saw my ex's behavior and acted accordingly. The rest knew that he would use me and dump me, and sat there and smiled in my face while he upended my life and spent my money. It occurred to me the other day that had I never taken up with this fool, I'd be on my way to getting out of the bad situation I was in when I moved into my new apartment. 

People think I'm so naive...no, I have no support system. I was hobbled early by my mother, and I'm still compensating for all the lies she told, the FAFSA forms she refused to sign, the insults she gave me once I was able to get into school on my own...I'm still healing. 

Today I talked to my brother, who thinks that everything is a joke. Everything is a joke to this jock, who doesn't know what I went through with our mother. He claims he knows, but he has happy memories, whereas I don't. The ones I thought I had were based on lies, so I try not to bring them to mind. I struggle with thoughts of suicide almost every day, but I keep going for my son. He has special needs, and it wears me out being a single parent. 

My family treats my abusive, lying, user of a mother like a queen, and they disparage me. My son's autism is ""God's judgment."" My illnesses, fake. 

I'm just done. My brother once again tried to give me a solution to a very big problem (my son doesn't understand danger, and will try to climb out windows, has already done so, his foot just healed). I finally, after months of telling him that it won't work, shouted at him that I'll try. Not that I will, but damn it, can you STOP and listen? My child is not neurotypical, I'm not either, your mother sucks, dude, and she short-sheeted me! I'm tired of living a lie! I'm tired of the depression and the lack of hope. I'm tired of being called a drama queen and ignored. I'm seriously about to just let go of everyone I know back east, minus one or two people.

She was beautiful and I really liked her from the very beginning. As I mentioned I was 100% sure that she was way out of my league and I didnt even bother trying to flirt.

After the party me and a friend wanted to hang out and I didnt know that she was there as well. Soon my friend had to left and we were alone so we just talked casually. Afterwards I told her that I really enjoyed being with her and she answered with "" I truly did as well"" so I typed: "" When will be the next time?"" While writing that I kinda shitted myself because im such a coward. I sure to be denied but she said: ""Why not tomorrow?"" I was like wauw wtf and said ""Sure!"".

&amp;nbsp;

**I have this psychiatrist** (my ""kind-of local doctor"" in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48t0vz/is_it_offensive_to_request_my_doctors_to_write_a/)).

1. In July 2015, my family and I started seeking help for our mental health problems. We spoke to my kind-of local doctor. She suspected I had BPD.

2. In August 2015, my family and I looked for a second opinion from another doctor. I found out I have ADHD coincidentally and so I started treatment with this doctor.

3. That doctor was busy (and twice as expensive as the first doctor) so we went back to the first doctor who is my ""kind-of local doctor"" in [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/48t0vz/is_it_offensive_to_request_my_doctors_to_write_a/). **She was initially unconvinced** that I had ADHD but in November/December 2015, she was finally convinced I had ADHD.

4. In January 2016, she diagnosed me with BPD.

5. In April 2016, she [took back her diagnosis](https://np.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/4jc529/adhd_in_the_dsm_is_it_describing_bpd/), but she does think I have some of the traits of BPD.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**Medication stuff:**

1. I was taking Concerta from August 2015 - September 2015.

2. In September 2015, my doctor at the time (the second doctor) took me off Concerta and [prescribed me antidepressants](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4lwp7r/doctor_prescribed_me_antidepressants_but_didnt/). I took antidepressants for the rest of the year. I didn't take methylphenidate for the rest of 2015.

3. I have been taking antidepressants and methylphenidate since January 2016.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**During her skepticism, she mentioned two things:**

- **There are cases where people outgrow ADHD**

(wait, isn't that one of the myths of ADHD? I asked her that, but she said that while she doesn't know the exact statistics, it has been known to happen or something)

- **When I was taking Concerta, I still had anger problems.**

**I don't really remember Concerta. I recall it sort of helped me but not really. Sort of like taking a really big cup of coffee I guess.** I'm on Ritalin now. I noticed the effects right away.

According to my notes (though I don't really remember), **while on Concerta, I had some problems concentrating partly out of anger with my parents** (Wouldn't you be angry with your parents if you found out you were diagnosed ADHD but weren't treated for it for at least a decade?).

My notes further state (this part I remember) that **after I started antidepressants, my anger significantly reduced** starting somewhere in the second or third week of taking them.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**To the best of my memory, my kind-of local doctor used the information in the last two paragraphs as part of her suspicion of me not having ADHD.**

&amp;nbsp;

**She said she was expecting methylphenidate to treat my anger**, but since my anger was treated by antidepressants, it's like I either don't have ADHD or I have a comorbidity. She didn't yet diagnose me with BPD, but she later did in January then took it back in April.

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**My then-psychiatrist's e-mail to me last year** (paraphrased, I added the bold):

&gt;I'm now convinced you have ADHD, based on the psychologist's report you sent me and the symptoms you said last time. I was hesitant at that time because **you said your anger was not resolved when you were taking Methylphenidate** (Concerta 18mg). I'm sure that you have borderline personality traits, but I'm not diagnosing you. Perhaps your anger was not resolved since you took Methylphenidate (Concerta 18mg) for a short duration only. It could be that you have ADHD as well as borderline personality disorder.

**Is methylphenidate supposed to treat anger or mood?**

I think it actually increases aggression in some cases. It's actually listed as a possible side effect. Then again the non-narcoleptics who take prescribed methylphenidate are pretty aggressive sometimes :P But seriously, for ADDers, have statistics shown a decline in anger upon taking methylphenidate?

This is my first post here, so I hope you'll hear me out. I hope you'll also understand why I think I can't go on any longer. This is my story, and it's a long one... so please bare with me.


So... I think I first started becoming depressed when I was a little kid. The earliest I remember feeling this way was when I found out my dad was cheating on my mom... I was a little kid, so I played a lot of those free to play online games, like Club Penguin and stuff. I signed up for a new game that looked cool and used my dad's email because I needed a parents approval. I didn't want to wait to play my new game until my parents woke up (it was early in the morning; I woke up early as a child) and my dad's email was already signed in, so I logged in and went to go confirm the email so I could start playing... I see messages from Craigslist in the inbox... I get curious and click on one because I'm a little kid and naturally curious...that's when my childhood was ruined. I see a nude picture of a woman with her legs spread...typing explicit messages to my dad, asking him to do explicit things...I click out and see a lot more from other women and even a guy... I also notice a Yahoo Messenger window is opened where he's in a bunch of chats with other women and men he wants to have sex with... Even with me being like 8 or 9, I realized what was going on... My dad was cheating on my mom. I was immediately devastated, depressed, and sick to my stomach. I knew this wasn't right...and that I had to tell my mom...but I was afraid of my Dad...he would yell at me and hate me...I finally work up the courage a year later to tell my mom...my dad calls me a liar and says I want to ruin their marriage. My mom doesn't believe me at all...she goes to check the computer for the emails...but they aren't there... because my Dad had deleted them to cover his tracks... A few months pass and I catch him on Craigslist; trying to find new people to cheat on my mom with... I tell my mom right away this time... He tells her he was actually on the laptop section of the site... looking to buy me a new computer... This is an obvious lie because I saw the nude pictures on the screen... but my mom believes him and he buys me a new computer to make his lie seem true... The last time I caught him was a few weeks later, when the cable box reported that someone had ordered $15 worth of porn channels for one night... I showed my mom because I was confused about it. She confronted my dad, who blamed it on me and said I ordered all that porn... keep in mind I'm only 9 or 10 years old and don't watch porn... This time, she doesn't believe him and he gets caught for ordering porn and is forced to apologize to me. I accept his apology, but in my head, I couldn't care less if he apologized to me... I mean, he lied and said it was me first... Also... I was still upset he hadn't gotten caught cheating on my mom... She didn't deserve to be cheated on, she didn't do anything wrong... To this day, my mom still doesn't know what he pulled and my dad still lives here, still married to my mom...


A few years pass... I'm now in fourth grade. I don't have any friends, I'm not popular, not into sports or anything like that, so I'm instantly an outcast. I was fine not having friends or being popular or anything like that... I mean... I was a little lonely, but that's not really that bad. Then... I started being bullied. The popular and sporty girls and guys would call me names and make fun of me and tell me how I'd never get a girl and that I was gay... I didn't let that get to me, even though it did hurt a little bit. One day at recess... I decided to try out soccer. I had never tried doing a sport before so I did this for fun. I got ridiculed by the sporty kids and yelled at for missing ""simple shots"" and was told how ""retarded"" I am. At this point, it was starting to hurt more, so I decided to tell my mom... We went into the principals office where they promised they would do something about it. They called one kid in and talked to him. That's all they did, that kid didn't even get punished, just told to stop. The next day my mom drops me off at school. We have to stay outside and wait until the morning bell rings to go inside. He decides to attack me and beat me to the cement. I throw him off me, but the whole fourth grade watched as I got attacked and even some teachers watched... Nothing happened... he didn't get in any trouble at all. I told my mom and we talked to the principal again. The kid who attacked me got in no trouble at all, he didn't even get talked to... I suffered through the rest of my fourth grade year, not wanting to go to school anymore, in fear of getting attacked. This is when my first suicide ""attempt"" happened... Sometime later that year, everything that had happened went to my head... I went home and bawled... I grabbed the biggest knife I could and held it to my wrist in front of my parents... I told them: I can't go back to school... I don't want to live anymore... I can't do this anymore... Stuff along those lines. They took the knife away from me and left me in my room alone bawling... We never spoke of this incident again.


A few years pass by and I'm in seventh grade now... My first year of middle school. Everyone tells me it's going to get better and that I'll love it in seventh grade. They tell me that no one will bully me and that I'll make friends and everything. I start to believe them and start to have some hope... The first half of the year goes pretty decently... But then a certain rumor starts that ruins the rest of the year and some of eighth grade. The rumor is that I jerk off in math class. I was in seventh grade, so I did know what jerking off was and all that, but I had never done it at school, and especially not in class. It started getting really out of control, people would even say with the teachers in the room... They would hear it but wouldn't care... We went to the principal. Since I was in middle school now, we had a new principal and we were in a different school, so we thought the new principal might actually do something. He didn't really help much... He called a few kids in, but there's not much you can do about rumors... I went the rest of the year and a lot of the eighth grade year feeling humiliated and hurt... I had no one, and all the girls made fun of me tons, because they all had heard the rumor... No chance of anyone being friends or dating someone who has apparently jerked off in math class...


A few years later is my ninth grade year... I meet a few friends who have my interests in common, which are listening to music and playing video games... I become really close to some of them... Ninth grade went pretty well... Better than most years...


This year was my tenth grade year... it was horrible. I started the year off by losing all my new ""friends"" who decided to ditch me for better people, just because I started to lose interest in the video games they liked and I didn't want to be around people much anymore. I started taking an interest in making music using my computer... I didn't think I was that bad, but my so called ""friends"" said that gaming was way better and that they were going to become famous YouTubers or pro gamers and that it was pathetic that I gave up gaming to make music... I ended up going to a few sites online to meet online friends once my other friends left me... This was one of the best decisions I made. I met some online friends who are some of the most amazing people I've met. Almost all of them are still my friends today. I even found my first girlfriend online... Anyways, My mom started to notice I was growing more and more sad everyday and distancing myself from everyone, even my family members. She said we should go see the doctor because she thinks I'm becoming depressed (I had known that I was probably depressed for awhile, but I hadn't seen a doctor about it until this year.) I talked to the doctor about everything I was feeling... and even about how I wanted to hurt myself and how I'm so anxious constantly... My doctor told me I have severe depression and anxiety. She placed me under essentially suicide watch for two weeks and prescribed me Lexapro. I wasn't allowed alone in a room for 2 weeks in fear I would kill myself. All sharp objects were confiscated from me and I was watched closely by my parents. Lexapro worked for awhile, but I started to self harm while taking Lexapro... My parents still don't know about that... 


Later on this year, I started questioning my sexuality... I'm still questioning it... I still don't know if I'm bisexual or not, so if someone could help me with that, I would be grateful... I've had to hide it from my parents,because they don't approve of LBGT... I got myself into a few serious relationships as well... Obviously, we dated online, because I have no one in real life, even to this day. Me and this girl knew each other for months and decided we both liked each other, so we decided to date. We dated for almost two months...it was going pretty good... Then I find out she's been cheating on me the whole time... I'm devastated... We break up and I'm even more depressed than before... I read online you can self harm with pencil sharpener blades, so I take the blades out of a pencil sharpener and cut my arms up until they bleed. I regret this immediately after and wear long sleeves for a while to conceal my cuts... I take a break from dating for a couple months... I couldn't handle another relationship for a long time after me and that girl broke up... Finally after around three months, I decide to try again... I meet a girl who I hit it off with immediately... We end up dating for around two months as well... I find out she's been sending nudes to people behind my back... I've never sent nudes to her or anyone else, but she had been sending nudes to other guys and not even her own boyfriend (even though I didn't want them anyways, that's child porn.) She broke things off with me and left... I did similar things to myself with the blades... That was about two months ago... I don't know when or if I will be ready to date someone again, my trust has been completely shattered too many times...


After me and my ex had broke up, I realized my meds weren't working very well considering I still felt super depressed; and also my anxiety was starting to affect me a lot more. We went back to my doctor and changed me to Zoloft. I have been doing a lot better with Zoloft, in both the depression department and anxiety department. 


A few days ago... I got my first job. The job is okay and all, but I'm starting to realize that I'm growing up and that I'm going to be in eleventh grade next year. It's depressing me how fast I'm growing up and I'm not liking the thought of leaving my mom for college... I need the job because I need money for a new computer and for college, but it's so strange having responsibilities and not being able to sleep in every morning in the summer... I don't like big changes, they make me very depressed... sometimes even suicidal. 


Ever since I started this new job, I'm starting to get the urge to cut or burn myself again... I don't want to live anymore and reflecting on all of my life is making me realize how crappy my life has been and that I don't feel like it'll ever get better... I feel alone... Like I have no one... A lot of my online friends have left me... I only have a few of my closest friends left, and some of my other closest friends have left me after I opened up to them about my depression and anxiety or they have left me for other reasons, such as getting in a fight at some point over something stupid and they don't want me back as a friend. After dating a few girls, I realize how lonely I am without a partner. I don't know if I'm ready for another partner, but I feel alone without one... With everything combined just crashing down on me...it's just depressing me more and more and making me want to end it all...I think I would rather be dead than be alive anymore...


Thanks for reading my story... I know how long it was, but I wanted to capture every little detail I could remember. I don't know if I can go on anymore, I feel so alone and depressed right now and I don't even know what to do... but thanks for hearing me out.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I don't think I can go on anymore...

1. **Major Depressive Disorder** is diagnosed in a patient who has at least one depressive episode that has certain characteristics.

2. This episode is called a **major depressive episode**. One of the features such an episode is that it lasts at least **two weeks**.

3. Atypical Depression is a **subtype** of Major Depressive Disorder.

1. So is the subdisorder ""atypical depression"" diagnosed after at least one ""atypical depressive **episode**""?

2. So the [symptoms here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical_depression#Symptoms) then describe **not** the subdisorder ""atypical depression"" but rather than an ""atypical depressive **episode**"" of the subdisorder ""atypical depression"" ?

3. Is an ""atypical depressive episode"" supposed to last for at least  **two weeks?** Wikipedia (and DSM) says **mood reactivity** is a symptom of ""atypical depression"" or an ""atypical depressive episode"". I believe then that if mood reactivity reduces the depression, then the length of the ""atypical depressive episode"" may vary.

4. **In terms of the episodes, how can atypical depression be a subtype of major depressive disorder?** I thought ""atypical depression"" or ""atypical depressive episodes"" has or have mood reactivity, hypersomnia and increased appetite while ""major depressive disorder"" or ""major depressive episodes"" has or have insomnia and decreased appetite and doesn't or don't have mood reactivity.

It seems to me that instead atypical depression and major depressive disorder are **types of depressive disorders** rather than atypical depression being a subtype of major depressive disorder, but there aren't depressive disorders [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder#Depressive_disorders) than major depressive disorder?

So to try and start this off on a semi-positive note, back in December was a horrible time for me and sadly I had a suicide attempt. However in a messed up way, it's good that it happened because now I've gotten the help I need and therapy. I'm not completely better but I need to keep reminding myself that I've done a good job as my counselor says.

However in the process I've lost so many people I considered my friends and lost most of my support system. I ended up having to drop out of school temporarily, as I couldn't focus at all and it was detrimental to my wellbeing as well. I've lost my girlfriend, and my other two friends as well. They know what has been happening with me, but none of them has bothered to check up on me or even attempted to talk to me, months afterwards and it's just so painful. It feels like I'm just as good as dead to them and that I don't exist. Not to mention with my social anxiety it's just a double kicker for me.. I feel so lonely. 

Now I have another partner.. More like a previous one. We've reconnected with each other and I'm so happy, but it's hard to be happy together when I'm so paranoid and terrified of them leaving me like the others have. They are supportive and understand what I'm going through since they have a mental illness as well, but it's just instilled in me to be silent about my problems in fear that if I do, that they will run away. I've been having nightmares of them leaving and ignoring me and it's getting hard to distinguish fantasy from reality. I can't tell what's happening much anymore but I can't stand it! 

I'd discuss this with my new counselor but my insurance is only covering 4 more sessions and that's basically it for the whole year... It seems to be happening so fast.. It's like as soon as I'm happy, an equal amount of despair comes raining in over me. I just want to be happy with the one I love and make these thoughts go away.

I just want there to be a record somewhere if I make a final decision. I know I'll never write a note if I make the decision, as it'll be made, most likely, on a whim. I suppose, I want people to be able to know ""why"", if anyone decides that they want to know. Who knows, maybe somebody on here will be able to help me, too. That's why I'm posting on this subreddit. Maybe someone can give me a reason to want to continue, to not give up. I certainly can't think of anything anymore. Some of this is my own thoughts/self-reflections, other bits are traits and decisions I've made pointed out by my counselor. These are the highlights/main points of my life, but there is much more to it as well.

I've always been a very lonely person. I think I remember a time when I could connect with people, when I cared about others; but it was a long time ago. In my early childhood, my step father started abusing my mother/siblings. He had always had anger management problems, but when he hurt his back working, it just got that much worse since he was always in pain. For some reason he would always try to avoid laying hands on me. I'm not sure why; maybe I unnerved him, or something. I've always been described as a ""cold"" or distant person, even when young. According to my counselor, around this time is when I ""messed up"", so to speak. I would always try to protect my family, when things got too bad. For some reason, if I stepped in (even as a young kid), my step dad would always stop whatever he was doing. However, it was usually only temporary, enough so he could calm down some before starting, just not as bad as before.

As the years wore on, I separated myself from my family. It was my own way to ""cope"". The reason my counselor says I messed up, however, is because I separated myself from everyone. Instead of caring about my mother/siblings, I just saw stopping my step dad as another chore. Just a part of life. So, 3-4 times a week I would just watch as he would push, scream at, and verbally tear down the rest of my family. I would only intervene if he raised in his hands at them. He did turn on me a few times, usually pinning/screaming at me, some shoving once I got older. He only hit me once, and I called the cops on him; he never did it again.

After separating myself from my family, and no longer caring, it was natural for me to do the same with other kids. My teachers would contact my parents, and tried to get them to sign me up for counseling multiple times in my childhood. However, my mother was very paranoid/anti-establishment. She had a slew of mental illnesses, including agoraphobia, bipolar disorder, depression, and very minor schizophrenia. She had medicine, but would self-medicate on days she felt like it, and skip when she didn't want to do it. As I aged, I also had to play ""counselor"" to my mothers' delusions and paranoia, including wondering whether or not my step dad was cheating on her and if I thought she was a good mother, so on and so forth. I was around eleven at this point in time. Naturally, during all of this I withdrew even further. I was at the point that when close family members died, people who I had grown up with (grandfather I had spent every weekend at for years), it didn't even phase me. I was the one to tell my step dad that his dad died, and I was very blunt about it; probably to the point of being cruel. He took it out on the rest of my family. That didn't bother me. . . but today, the fact that it didn't bother me, does bother me.

This went on for years. It was life for me. Playing mediator when needed, playing counselor when needed, and just watching the rest of the time. I was. . . lonely. I didn't have any friends, and didn't want any. People were different than me. I never felt happy, sad, angry, anything. I was just there. A few teachers noticed, and tried to bring it up, but my parents never listened. To everyone else, I was just an unfailingly polite and quiet little boy, and they were happy with that.

When I was 16, I met a girl. We started carpooling from work together, and quickly became best friends. I'm still not sure what it was, or why it happened, but we clicked. I did, and still do, care for her greatly. In my whole life, she's the only person I can even say I cared for the smallest amount, and can recall it. We hung out for years, then eventually started dating. Finally, I turned 18. I desperately wanted to get away, and the girl I was with was very pro-military, so it sounded like a good idea. I also decided to marry this girl, and we did. I don't regret it, it was an interesting experience. Most importantly, it got me away from the area I grew up in. Away from the people. The memories. Everything.

A few years in, I was diagnosed with a near-benign tumor. It was doing some damage, but was relatively harmless; just in the way. However, it kept recurring. I spent the next two years getting four knee surgeries, to eventually get medically discharged from the military. When making our plans for what to do, I finally followed what my wife wanted to do, and that was to move closer to our families back home. She had a very positive relationship with her family, after all.

Now, my wife was my life. At this point, I still haven't connected with anyone. Aside from school, she was the only thing I had that was ""mine"", something I could be proud of. A family of my own, maybe I could be somebody, and live for myself. We were much closer to home than I was comfortable with, but that was okay; I still had her, and we were continuing our lives in school. Fast forward 6 months, I realize my wife has a crush on a guy at school. That's fine, a crush is a crush. People get over them, and giggle about them during the months that they're happening. Whatever. But, she starts going out with him more. Spending time together, doing whatever. Finally, the last straw is my birthday; about four months ago. She and the guy are very close, much more than I am comfortable with.

That day, she has a school event she has to go to, the guy is with her. Then, they go swimming together. Then, they go to the mall together. Then get something to eat. By the time she gets home, it's 5pm and I haven't heard from her all day. The ""present"" she got me was something I specifically told her I didn't want a week before. The one thing I wanted to do, which was what we always did on my birthday, she had done with him; go out to get something to eat. She blamed it on me, saying that it was okay for her to assume that, because I'm not big into holidays/birthdays, and that she knew I wouldn't care. That was when I realized my marriage was over.

Stupidly, however, I didn't break up with her when I realized it was over. In reality, I was terrified of being alone again. I didn't even realize it, but I had actually fought off my loneliness years ago with her. She gave me something to live for besides the duties in my family, it was a real connection with somebody that I cared for. A real friend. I didn't want to go back. So, I stayed with her, and we ""tried"" to fix it. A week later, when I found out they'd been ""sexting"" each other for awhile now, I tried to break up with her. She swore to cut off contact, and pulled me back in. A week later, when I found out they were hanging out again, I asked her why we were doing this, and said I wanted to break up. She blamed me and we somehow didn't break up. I barely remember these weeks at this point. A few days later, I found out they had been flirting again, and he had been sending her some suggestive texts. I'm not sure if they were actually ""sexting"" again, because I didn't want to know. I texted her saying we were done. She said she just wanted some time to herself to figure things out, then we should try again, so I should find a hotel for a few days.

Now, I know I was weak and stupid. I never really thought it would work out; I even knew I wouldn't ever forgive her. I just ignored it, and allowed myself to reconnect each time. Because even though it hurt, much more than I ever imagined, it wasn't as daunting as my fear of being alone was. Finally, it became enough. Hell, I had to ""trick"" her into letting me break up with her. By this point, she really did have me wrapped around her finger. I honestly couldn't break up with her, as it was. She still hadn't done anything physical with him, though I knew it was coming. So, I went home for the weekend. For the first time in years, I went back to the place I was running from, that I hated.

During my stay, my only goal was to end the one relationship that I've ever really cherished. I gave her the okay to hang out with him, saying I trusted her to be friends. I waited a day, and sure enough by the end of the day she was being distant with me and would make the occasional side comment about him. So I brought up breaking up again, once we had been apart for a day (so she wouldn't feel guilty when seeing me) and having had her spend the day with him (so she would be thinking of him), and she accepted. I spent the next few days visiting people I'd rather never see again in my life, and seeing areas/memories that I had ignored for years. All the while, knowing my wife was with someone else. It was by far the worst day of my life.

Throughout these months of us being off and on, she has destroyed any self-esteem I previously had. From telling me she's not attracted to me, telling me she can't be proud of who I am (the guy she's dating is graduating, I'm just starting), to even telling me that she doesn't think she loved me; just used me to get away from the hometown she disliked as well. Despite everything, I had never had even remotely poor self-esteem. In just a few short weeks, she absolutely ruined that.

This all leads to know. I've spent the last two months absolutely alone, and it's been awful. It's far worse than I ever remembered, and I don't see any hope. I feel empty. I feel like there is this vast gulf of empty space between me and everyone else. Even inanimate things. I don't know how to describe it, but it feels like everything is almost surreal, and I'm just drifting along, alone and. . . well, just empty. For some reason, now all of the things that happened in the past, my childhood, are coming out to bother me. I'd never cared before, so why now? I can't sleep without having nightmares about all of it. If I don't have nightmares, I dream pleasant dreams of me and my wife; only to wake up alone. For the past couple months, I haven't slept more than five hours in a day.

My only current means of dealing with any of this is through self-harm. I cut myself a few times off and on when I was younger, because it let me feel something. Now, it worries me how much I do it. I can't make it a single day without, because if I don't have the distraction, the silence becomes so loud. The gulf between me and everything expands until I do something, and the pain re-centers me, and straightens the universe back out for me.
I love my wife. I love her desperately, and want to see her succeed. I want to see her happy, with a loving family, getting everything she's ever wanted. At the same time, I hate her. I hate her more than I've ever hated another living person. I want her to suffer and fail, I want her to go through what I have and come out the ""normal"" that she wants. And I hate myself for hating her, because I love her. I have so many conflicting emotions, and so many new emotions, that I feel like I'm being torn to pieces by them.

I live in a town I don't like, which is far to close to a town I hate. I have nobody, and I know nobody. I have no clue what I want to do for the future, and though I enjoy the thought of teaching (my current major), I'm not sure it will be ""fulfilling"" for me, at least enough to be my life long career. I don't have any real social skills, because I've never needed them. I'm not awkward or weird, just polite and distant; maybe a little cold. No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to feel ""warm"" towards people, to try and be their friends. Aside from my one meeting with my counselor, I haven't spoken to another person in almost two months. Both of my summer classes are online, so I'm not going to see anyone consistently until September. I'm not sure how long I can make it. I know that I don't want to die. But, I can also say with absolute certainty, that I don't want to live either.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Fearing Loneliness, X-Post"

I am a trainee clinical psychologist undertaking research in relation to thoughts of suicide. The study is concerned with how people that struggle with low mood do or don't develop thoughts of suicide. In that regard, I am hoping to recruit people that have **and** have not experienced thoughts of suicide, so anyone can participate.

I have received permission from a moderator of the forum to post a link to my study. It is a questionnaire that takes approx 10-15 minutes to complete. The study is entirely anonymous and a draw for one of four £25 ($36) Amazon vouchers will be made for those that take part.

I would really appreciate your participation and thank you advance to those that take part. The link is below:

I also wake up sweating. In one dream I did end up getting killed and I woke up in such a bad way I refused to go back to sleep afterwards.

If the dream doesn't involve me being chased or me being in danger, it'll be one where I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or if I'm awake. For example, if I sleep next to my fiancé and we have a conversation in bed before we both fall asleep, I'll have dreams where I'm having different versions of the conversation and I wake up wondering what was the real conversation was, I don't know what was reality or what wasn't.

No matter what dream I have, I wake up agitated and on edge. If it's dark outside I can just about get to sleep, my mind will play tricks with me and I'll see and hear things that aren't there, I'll also daydream about scenarios which involve intruders and monsters etc. After this I'll be so on edge I won't be able to relax. I find sleeping whilst it's light outside helps this a little bit.

I'm not on any medication and I don't drink alcohol or do drugs so it can't be anything related to that. But right now I'm on edge about sleeping and I dread it.

I think I'm doing better mentally, since I saw my pdoc last night and didn't request a med change (and was honest about having abused vyvanse, which surprised me).

I'd also significantly cut down on my drinking and didn't have a celebratory beer after my workout today.

At this point, I was just as normal as normal can be. I didn't give much of a damn about being naked or anything. I was- arguably- developing really normally and stuff was fine. So, I went in, and my normal doctor was away on vacation and I saw a random other doctor (still unsure about whether this person was male or female). 

It was the first time I went in without my mom, because I felt safe and comfortable and whatever. 

The doctor didn't ask or tell me what was going on, but began removing my gown and... ""inspecting"" everything. But it was odd. Doc wasn't just checking up on me, doc was fondling and groping. It wasn't just ""checking my development"", the doc stimulated my nipples, ran hands through my pubic hair and down my clit (still fondling up above). And then proceeded to stimulate my clit before inserting a finger into me. He/ she also said something about most young women shaving their pubic hair, so I should shave mine too. But like, this was said in kind of a disproving way, like other people wouldn't like or accept me if I didn't shave. 

I have never been OK after this. Never. I didn't talk about it with my mom, because I thought it was normal. No one was in the room with me, so I didn't know what was normal and what wasn't, and I was scared it WAS normal, because it scared me and stuff. It wasn't until YEARS later (way past the statute of limitations, regardless) that it came up in therapy, and I learned IT'S NOT FUCKING NORMAL. 

I knew I had been raped. I knew, but I didn't know. The line was so blurry because this was a doctor. I mean, we're supposed to trust doctors, right???  But for years, I cancelled dr. appointments or didn't go. I refused to go, refused to undress (still do; modesty is my friend). Still can't even deal with the topic of sex without changing the subject. When I was 11, I shattered the arch of my foot and did so much damage that it actually might require amputation someday (the bones re- fused THROUGH the muscle; like, they ripped a hole through the ligament connecting the big toe and the arch to the leg, so I can't move my big toe) and I didn't see a doctor for it. I was too scared (that and my dad- it was his weekend- refused to take me, but whatever). 

I've grown up so scarred without even realizing the extent of that doctor visit. I don't even date anymore, because men scare me. My first kiss happened against my will; I kept saying no, but he kissed me anyway and that's when I knew I couldn't trust anyone enough to be in a relationship with. 

I mean, I could write a book. But suffice it to say THAT FUCKED ME UP. 

I want to be in a relationship, I want to have consensual sex someday, I want to be able to trust someone enough to go on more than just a few dates. But I can only date virgins. I feel like at 21, most people are generally CHOOSING not to have sex, especially if they're attractive. I feel like I can trust them not to hurt me. 

I should also add that I have been molested twice after that incident, once by a neighbor and AGAIN BY A FUCKING DOCTOR. Most recently, I tried to press charges and I reported him to the medical board, but the police called it heresay and the medical board gave him a warning. 

I just... I WANT TO BE NORMAL. I want to love, I want to be happy. But I can't trust anyone. Twice, by a doctor. TWICE. If someone can risk their medical license over getting their jollies (a medical license that takes 4 years of undergrad, 4 years of med school, and 3+ years of residency to GET), then HOW am I supposed to trust anyone who has even LESS to lose???? I feel like I have to approach every situation I encounter with rape goggles. It's happened more than once, and so far the only sexual experiences I have had have been non- consensual. Everyone is automatically labelled a rapist in my brain, because I'd rather be prepared than blindsided again. I'd rather be prepared to throw a punch than have it happen again. And so I just don't get close to anybody. Though I do seem to be getting close with women... 

I've recently come out as bisexual, and I don't know... I think a lot of it has to do with safety. Statistically, it's practically unheard of- a woman raping another woman. There's something a lot more gentle- seeming about women than men. So, I don't know. Maybe I'd rather swear off dating men altogether. But I wouldn't like that. 

I find men attractive. I just can't trust them not to hurt me. I mean, again, how am I supposed to trust someone with less to lose than a medical license/ practice??? It just doesn't make any sense. None of it does. I don't know how someone could do that to a kid... 

I don't know what to do or how to get better from this? Will I ever be whole again? Every time I tell anyone, I feel damaged. I feel like people pity me and I'm weak. I feel like I'm worth less than someone who is ""normal"". I feel ashamed, like I should have said no or fought him off, or done something to stop it... 

I feel AWFUL. I don't think I will ever find a mate, because of this. I used to think my preference for virgins was because I was super religious, but I became an agnostic (leaning towards atheism) when I was in high school, and so I know it's not that... But it's like being between a rock and a hard place. If I only date virgins, they (statistically speaking) tend to be either ugly, religious, or some other kind of strange. But people who aren't... I get panic attacks, I detach emotionally, and I completely shut myself off from them because I associate sex with something awful, and if they've had sex then they must be awful too. I know it's illogical. It makes NO sense. But neither does rape, so... 

It just seems like either way I'm screwed and doomed to end up alone. And sometimes I cry about that, because I desperately DON'T want to be alone. I want to have a partner whom I can love and be vulnerable with, and whom I can share a deep connection with. I mean, sometimes I just want a warm chest to bury my head in, or a mate who will hold me close. And I don't think I'm wrong for wanting that. For wanting a relationship. I know, I know, I am an independent woman and I don't need no man. But that doesn't stop me from wanting one. 

This is the first time I have talked openly about what happened and how I feel about it. I hope this can lead to healing.

Last semester was the worst it's ever been, I had trouble concentrating on studying, I was failing tests, failing classes, blaming myself, panicking, crying. I had never felt so much stress, guilt, apathy, or despair ever in my life. I had a lot of horrible thoughts, to the point where I am grateful to still be there.  

It took a long time for me to admit to myself that something was wrong. And it took a lot of convincing from my boyfriend that something was wrong. I didn't want help, I wanted to get through this on my own. To prove to myself I was strong enough.  

But that's the thing about depression, you don't really get to win on your own. I didn't talk to anyone about what was going on, except my boyfriend. I told no one that I was struggling, that I was failing, because I was ashamed. I thought I was ""just stupid"" and ""not good enough,"" it wasn't until he urged me I needed help and I realized my life was being severely affected did I actually seek help.  

That was in February. Now in June, I have just had my two week check up to see how antidepressants(celexa/citalopram) have been helping me. The difference has been amazing. I never realized how low I felt until experiencing what it feels like to be hopeful, optimistic, relaxed, and at peace with myself again.  

My point is, it took me FOUR MONTHS after seeking treatment to actually START treatment. I wish I had sought help sooner, so I could have gotten better sooner. I wish I had reached out to people, talked to someone about how I was struggling. I wish I had admitted to myself that it's OKAY to seek help, that I didn't have to do this alone.  

If you're feeling hopeless, if you feel like you've given up, that you're worthless, that you don't deserve to be happy, that you CAN'T be happy...PLEASE seek help NOW. Don't wait until next week. Or next month. Start now, because it's a long road and and you already need help. It's okay to need help. It's okay to talk about this! The sooner you start, the sooner you get better.

I don't think suicide assessments are effective tools when screening patients with BPD. Since our emotions can vary in intensity from minute to minute, hour to hour, the assessment isn't, as I see it, an accurate overall picture. 

Today my therapist noticed how ridiculously anxious I was, and he later said ""you were crawling out of your skin"". I made some 'vague' statements about suicide/self-harm and that was my downfall. I hadn't taken the one medication that helps control my anxiety and the thoughts of suicide and self-harm. I told him that, and I said I had it with me. I wanted him to tell me to take it, but he wouldn't, he made me make the decision on taking or not taking it. At that point I was trying to do damage control, so I took it. We proceeded with the assessment, the med kicked in halfway through, and I completely changed. It was noticeable, and by the time we finished I was in a completely different frame of mind than an hour before. I successfully avoided the hospital. 

While taking the medication helped in this situation, this hasn't always been the case. I've been to the ER before where I sit there for several hours, get the med and psych screenings, and then am discharged because I'm no longer in any 'immediate danger'. 

I think BPD needs to be screened differently in regards to suicide. Since a lot of us struggle with chronic suicidality, answering questions of ""do you have a plan?"" is, to simply put it, unfair. And admitting there's some form of an established plan ups the chances of hospitalization. So, what can be done differently? I've started to use the terms ""active plan"" and ""inactive plan"". The inactive plan relates to my chronic suicidality, it's already there and will always be there, however I have no intention to act on it. The active plan refers to a new plan, or previously inactive plan, that I'm taking steps to develop or refine the details. There's an obvious intention to act on the plan, and this is when I'm not in a good space mentally/emotionally. 

Another issue that surrounds suicide assessments with BPD is how familiar it can become. Answering the same questions over and over, completely multiple assessments, it becomes fairly easy to manipulate the scoring. This is a part of what I refer to as damage control, having the score low enough to avoid hospitalization but at a moderate level to avoid obvious straight-up lying. Part of it is intentional, of course, I recognize I can be a manipulative POS at times. But another part is my BPD kicking in and I end up, at times, sabotaging someone's attempts to help me. It's another way to push people away, and I haven't figured out a way around this one. Professionals are always going to err on the side of caution because of the potential ethical and legal ramifications that may occur. Unfortunately, this leaves a large portion of those with BPD in the situation that can actually be detrimental to treatment. Indirectly it seems to further some of the BPD symptoms (avoidance, self-sabotage, manipulation, etc.) that are trying to be treated.

Then having read a meta-analysis of psychiatric treatment outcomes by Robert Whittaker in his books Mad in America and Anatomy of an Epidemic, I decided to embark upon an unethical study, with me as the test subject. I decided to go completely unmedicated.

The general public often associate unmedicated mental health patients with some wild-eyed looney, who has slipped their straightjacket, ducked the tackles of the hospital orderlies and legged it out of some mental health institution. There is an assumption that people with mental health problems are homicidal maniacs, and a danger to the public. I'm here to dispel that myth.

Going unmedicated is not something I would ever advocate. The withdrawal effects from psychiatric medication are likely to be severe and unpredictable. It's not something that should ever be done without consulting your doctor. However, I did it, and this is my account of what happened.

Firstly, coming off medication is hard. Really hard. I've had comedowns from drug abuse that haven't been as bad as coming off anxiety medications, for example. What goes up must come down, and there's no avoiding the fact that coming off a 'feel good' medication means that you are going to feel bad. Really bad.

Fundamentally, that's why many of us take medication, isn't it? To feel normal. To feel better than we would do without it. That's certainly how I got mixed up in the whole world of mental health in the first place... because I felt terrible. I was exhausted and suicidal and depressed and demotivated and I didn't enjoy anything. I needed happy pills, because all my happy had leaked away somewhere, and I was just spending 14 to 16 hours a day asleep, and the rest of it in bed hoping that the world would go away.

The thing is, the unnatural 'happy' pills destabilised me, and my mood then swung too happy, and entered a mood cycle of alternating periods of depression and hypomania. Enter the mood stabilisers. It's starting to sound like a story about the old woman who swallowed a fly, isn't it? For those who are unfamiliar with the story, she then swallowed a spider to catch the fly, and then something else to catch the spider and so on, until she swallowed something so large it killed her.

The problem with trying to treat human moods with medications is that the brain has evolved to be homeostatic. That is to say, the brain has evolved its own mechanisms to maintain stability, and anything you introduce artificially will quite naturally destabilise those systems.

The stability of your moods can also be destabilised by supposedly normal things. We are all supposed to be able to cope with the pressure of exams, work, domestic duties and so on, but for some of us, it will all become too much. Is this mental illness, or are these 'nervous breakdowns' actually something that threaten to blight the lives of every single person? Is it a lottery as to whether the stress will become overwhelming?

I self-medicated for stress for years, using copious amounts of alcohol. Of course, at work you then have to compensate for the foggy mind caused by a hangover, so you start to drink strong coffee. I was probably having the equivalent of about 12 shots of espresso every single day. The amount of caffeine contained in those shots was practically the same as being an amphetamine addict, and indeed my boss at the time - who got me into this destructive lifestyle - had the racing speech and fast jerky movements that you would associate with a speed freak.

When I moved onto harder stimulants, including a drug that would keep me awake for over a week at a time, I found that my mind was not as robust as I had assumed it would be. I managed to induce within myself, symptoms that were unmistakably schizophrenic.

Consumed with paranoid delusions, hearing and seeing things and with completely warped perceptions, I was very mentally unwell indeed. This divided medical opinion. Some professionals wanted to treat me as if I had permanently damaged my brain, and had now become a schizophreniac. Others could see that the symptoms were likely to abate, if I just got some sleep, had some food &amp; drink and started to detox and let my frazzled brain recover. Thankfully, the latter was the correct opinion.

Does that mean that all schizophreniacs can recover and live normal unmedicated lives? No, sadly not. I've seen quite a lot of people who have been suffering acute episodes of mental illness as a result of circumstances or substance abuse, and these people have recovered as soon as they were removed from the situation that landed them in hospital. However, there are clearly some patients who are either too badly damaged, or have some other pathology that is driving their illness, and medication is necessary to control the psychosis &amp; mania.

For my own part, I have lived without caffeine for many years now, and I try to keep alcohol consumption to a minimum. I've been medication free for a few years, but I have dipped back into both sedatives, sleep aids as well as powerful stimulants, during times of crisis. It's been a few months since the last time I dabbled with anything psychoactive, and I'm still suffering rebound anxiety and depression.

Life is incredibly hard right now. I'm stalked by suicidal thoughts all the time, and stress is almost unbearable. I would dearly love the comforting embrace of a chemical security blanket. I long for intoxication. However, despite the hard, sharp edges of daily existence, at least my emotions aren't blunted and I feel like I have wonderful mental clarity.

Every day is a struggle, and my perception of time is completely warped. I feel like this depression is going to last forever, and I assume that everybody hates me and that I have nothing to offer the world, and I'm never going to be happy ever again. However, I'm able to be very rational, and I can see that my perceptions have merely been warped by my mood, which is partly because I'm still recovering from the abuse of sleeping pills, anxiety drugs and stimulants.

It would be easy to write off my tale as that of a drug addict, but that's not really the story. In actual fact, self medication with the 'bad' chemicals appeared only very recently, and well after I was diagnosed with various mental health problems and had already been taking the 'good' chemicals (i.e. medications). All psychoactive chemicals are destabilising, by their very nature.

Self medication is a disastrous path to go down, but all attempts to force your moods to go one way or the other without changing the environment that you're in, will be doomed to failure. I wanted happy pills so that I could remain in the rat race, and maintain a standard of living that I had gotten used to. However, what I really needed was to escape that bullshit world.

Propping up my ailing mental health so that I could continue to work a job that I hated and that bored the shit out of me was a dumb choice. Mental health is too precious to fuck about with using pills and potions. If you're not feeling great, that's probably because you need to get out in green spaces more, eat healthier, get some new friends, ditch that mean abusive partner, disown those horrible parents who never congratulate you on your achievements and always give you a hard time, and quit trying so hard to impress people and be somebody you're not.

This is my prescription for life: be myself and tell everybody to shove their ill-informed opinions about my life up their arse. Nobody's an expert in my life and how to live it, and so many of the so-called experts are actually unhappy themselves, nor are they bringing happiness to the lives of the people they advise. Judge people on their results.

Fundamentally, there is an epidemic of mental health issues, and nobody is curing anyone, so trust nobody except for yourself, and do what feels right for you.

In episode 3 of the second season, ""Auto Erotic Assimilation,"" Rick ends the episode by playing Russian Roulette with a gadget he makes after his episode long fling with his old flame, Unity, leaves him.

This just fucking destroyed me because it's a fucking animated representation of what my life feels like right now. In January my girlfriend of a few years broke it off with me. That on top of the depression I've always had and tried to deal with just broke me. And I'm still dealing with both months later. 

Just as in the show, no one around me seems to care or notice the extent of my depression through the entirety of my life (even my ex while she was with me), just as through the series and in those last couple of minutes in the episode no one seems to see what Rick is going through. 

Just as in those final minutes, I've always had self destructive tendencies, but not in the way of trying to kill myself, I've only ever tried once and I'm too much of a coward to try again. Instead I play Russian Roulette with random shit in my life, usually petty childish things such as speeding and haphazardly passing cars on a two lane highway without looking, or drinking a liter of vodka or whiskey in one sitting, or trying drugs to name simple examples. Just something that knocks on death's door and gives me a numbing adrenaline rush from misery or just eventually kill me. Just as in the show Rick drinks something which he knows will make him pass out just before he turns on his device, struggling to stay awake and finally succumbing to his potion and getting out of the device's way just before it goes off. And the kicker is that just before it cuts to credits it shows someone  with a weed eater just steps away from Rick's unconscious body in plain sight, not know what just happened moments ago. 

I don't know, I just.. I started the show for the jokes and laughs and ended up bawling because of this episode's ending. It really took a swing at my heart and I've never in my life related to something so intensely let alone the last 2 minutes of a goddamn cartoon on Adult Swim.

Some background info: I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and some other stuff back in February after I tried hanging myself in my closet. I spent a week in the mental hospital, and there, I learned about the little things in life that made everything so enjoyable. I realized how much I missed my bed, my sketchbooks, my clothes, and other things. After leaving the hospital, I was initially ""happy"" for the first few days. Then, the reality of life just kind of hit head-on rather unexpectedly. I go to therapy once a week, and family therapy once a month (since I'm a minor).

Anywho, my original supports and reasons to keep on living was my family and friends. Fortunately, I'm lucky to have such caring family members and caring friends. They all wish I would get well soon and offer their help and ears whenever. I know I'm blessed with this fact, and I do really appreciate it all.

But, I can't tell them anything anymore. Before I went to the hospital, I would have. I would reach out for help, and they would offer their support completely. However, there was this intense feeling of guilt that I couldn't just shake out of, and I just ended up getting more sad and down. The whole reason why I almost hung myself in the first place was because of this guilt. I had told a few friends how I truly felt, and then they started arguing with one another because they didn't really understand what my depression is like. In fact, I had one friend that I reached out to tell me ""Just get over it"" and implied if I couldn't, I was weak. After that incident, I lost my best friend and I stopped trusting everybody with my feelings. My biggest support, my mother, makes me feel the most guilt. Knowing the struggles she went through back when she first immigrated to America makes me feel like a failure. As a single mother, she had to juggle around so much for my sister, my brother, and me. She came to America knowing absolutely no English and went through so much obstacles. She’s been diagnosed with some rare case of Hep B that affects her liver severely, and in the past she had to abandon her eldest son because she couldn’t afford to keep all of our family together anymore. At one point, we were homeless and had to beg for food. But that was in the past, and now she looks forward to the future. Honestly, I look up to my mother. I’m not even sure how she managed to survive through all of that, for I surely wouldn’t have. But to this day, she stills struggles a lot with her own problems like the bills and other things. Having her worry about me makes me extremely guilty and I can’t handle it anymore.

Which brings me to today. Originally, I had one outlet I knew I could have depended on to get all my feelings out. I see two therapists twice a week, and one of which was a “Skills Coach” who would help me find ways of coping. Since he was just there to help me figure out alternatives to cutting (I used to cut but stopped after my mom started checking my skin), I didn’t feel any obligation to tell him everything like I did with my main therapist. Initially, I could have told him whatever I wanted to, and it would’ve just been between us. With my main therapist, whatever I said would be alerted to my mom, and that would just cause more guilt and pain for me and her. Anyway, I recently had a therapy session with my skills coach and I was ready to vent all of my feelings out to him, but then I was notified there was a change to the contract.

If I reported something that might have insinuated that I recently self harmed, or plan on doing so, he would have to report it to my mom. I was devastated, because I didn’t want my mom to know any of these things anymore. I tried finding loopholes, suggesting that it was my “friend” I was describing. But the contract covered that part as well. If he suspected that I was trying to hide the fact, he would need to report it to my mom regardless.

I bit my tongue and lied my way for the first time with him. “Things are alright.” “Nope, no self harm.” “No plan”

It really hit me hard when I got home. I felt completely alone.

I can’t tell my friends any of this anymore, because I already had tried to and it didn’t work out. Their worry would cause more guilt which would result in me feeling a whole lot worse.

I can’t tell my mom, because I already had. Telling my mom I had cut just made her so upset and this intense feeling of guilt erupted within me. Now she asks to see my skin everyday, asking if I’m ever sad, wondering what I was up to. She really is caring mother, but that wonderful quality just made it worse. Every time she would do any of those things, guilt always comes to me.

And now, I can’t tell my therapist anymore. The last place/person I thought I could really express myself without fear, disappointment, or guilt stopping me.

Being this alone makes me feel so… hopeless. Last night I was choking myself (because choking doesn’t really leave a big scar/mark and it’s accessible) when the scariest thought hit me. I could end it right then and there I realized. I could hang myself, or asphyxiate myself. I spent 10 minutes thinking about the consequences, the permanent sadness of my friends and family I leave behind, but at that point I didn’t care.

I convinced myself that this was all just a game. “They only exist if I exist.” “When I cease to exist, so will they.”

I cried all last night, thinking of everything I could have been, and I could have done. I cried because of the utter failure that I am. I cried because of the embarrassment to everyone I bring who ever believe in me. I cried because of my fucked up head, because I’m not normal, and because I could never be normal. I cried because all I bring to people is misery, pain, anger, frustration, but never joy. I cried because I could never be anyone or anything that ever brings joy, or happiness, or laughter to anyone’s lives. I cried because I’m not dead yet. I cried because I was born in the first place. I cried because of all the times I could’ve made someone happy, and yet I didn’t. I cried because of all the people I could’ve made happy, and I could’ve helped if I never existed in the first place.

Yet for some reason, even though all my life I had thrown these words out into no one, out into nothing, and into just empty darkness, it feels nice to do it again. And again. And again. Because there’s some sort of sick, twisted appreciation when you pour your sorrows out into blackness, and nothing ever calls back. Nothing ever scolds you for what you are. Nothing ever criticises you for your shortcomings. Nothing ever calls you names, alienates you, calls you selfish, or calls you a freak. Yet, nothing ever calls back, nothing comes to comfort you, to tell you it’s alright, to love you and hold you. Nothing ever comes for you to love back, for you to hold back, for you pour your feelings out towards either and give it support for its sorrows either. It’s pleasant torture.

But who even am I anymore, if I wasn’t such a monster? Who would I be if I wasn’t depressing, if I wasn’t selfish, if I wasn’t an arsehole, if I wasn’t a freak, if I wasn’t worthless, if I wasn’t angry, if I wasn’t greedy? I wouldn’t be myself.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Idle Thoughts

I don't have SA but my BF does and it's been kind of a struggle so I'm hoping for some insight. I have my own issues so I know that a blanket term like ""SA"" means that it isn't experienced the same way by everyone but I'll delineate a few issues that I hope people can help me understand how to best handle.


I'm a programmer and D's a sysadmin and we're both really into the outdoors. So being with each other is pretty ""easy"". The problem is, we used to work together and I recently changed jobs and I'm having a hard time expressing my needs without completely upsetting him. I'm his first relationship (we're both 30).



For starters, his level of communication can drastically vary from day to day. For example, yesterday I was supposed to meet him after work to drive over to his place. I kinda' need to know when to leave my office since while I know the general time he's done with work, it can vary depending on a myriad of things. Yesterday he was very responsive - I wouldn't think he was mad at all. Then the next day, I barely heard from him and I just kinda' drove and showed up to his work.



When I got there, he said hi, some stuff about how nothing he's doing is working and I kinda' just nodded and decided to talk to an old coworker until he finished up. When we got to his place, he said ""I'm kind of freaking out because nothing's working."" He's broken his router last week and we spent some time trying to fix it (wifi was up, but couldn't get an IP, stuff like that). Also had some stuff to reformat on my laptop.



So after almost a year, I have learned that when he's freaking out about something, it seems like he's mad at me but I don't think he is? After a few hours, suddenly he seemed fine and we were intimate and it was great. I'd kinda' like to know what made him suddenly relax after apparently freaking out for multiple hours. We both smoked a little weed - was that it? What calms people with SA down?



Earlier I tried to have a conversation about the lack of responses I'd get from my texts. I said now that we don't work together, I'd like to talk on the phone and he said ""that's hard for me."" I didn't argue with him on this - I just said if you could make the effort, I'd appreciate it. On this end, I guess I just want some insight. He never seems to have trouble talking to me in person, so what makes texts and phone calls harder? When I worked with him, I did notice that he'd type and retype messages a few times before sending them (I sat behind him, like a creeper).




When we had that conversation...it didn't go well. He cried and I'm not even sure what we were both sad for or even saying after a certain point. The next time we saw each other, it was to meet up for a beer (we go to this bar that has none people - really, none). At first, he seemed cold and distant like I described above - he said he was freaking out over work and us (""why us?"" ""because the last time we talked, it didn't go so well""). I didn't really say anything, just held his hand and said ""I'm sorry you feel bad. I love you.""




Then like after some time, suddenly he was relaxed again and we had a great night. Again - what causes this change?? Was it the beer this time? He'd only had 1 IPA at this point.



I will say, he has made an obvious effort with the texts and phone calls. But I'm afraid I can't tell him ""I really need you to be able to tell me when it's okay to start driving to your office, even if you're having a bad day"" without it turning into some sort of catastrophe.




The other issue has only been one since I left the office. He's become super sensitive to what are like, innocuous jokes to me. Like earlier today, I'm pushing him out of bed and saying I need him to not be super slow. I said something about his morning pace and he said ""you're being mean again.""


""What do you mean?""

I don't know how to respond to that. Like, yeah, I am, but it isn't mean. The night before he opened up a case of USBs that had various linux distro installs on it and I said ""that's so cute!"" and he looked hurt (wtf) and I said ""that means I think you're hot...""



NSFW example - we were making out, my hands were wandering, i didn't mean to tickle him, but i learned his balls can be very ticklish. i've tickled him before and it wasn't an issue. this time when i was laughing, he stopped fingering me, looked SUPER hurt and said, ""you're making fun of me."" i pulled him in and said, ""no..."" (but i mean, laughing at tickling someone is the point of tickling someone...i'm not really sure how to explain what seems obvious to me).



Another thing I'm looking for advice on. Every 7th weekend (which happens to be this weekend, so I'm feeling stressed) - D's on-call. I understand that the notion of taking phone calls is stressful. I just don't really know what to do when I'm there and he's freaking out massively over this.



I'm not really expecting a ""normal"" or even ""nearly perfect"" relationship but it's so hard to understand things he's feeling when i think A - he doesn't even know what he's feeling at times and B - even if he did, he'd have a hard time telling me. so i guess i made this post for some insight. thanks.",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,dating someone with SA

Swallowed in the ebb and flow of dark emotions and thoughts that come and go like the tides. When I try to describe to people what it is like, I go back to the description of someone else who described it like being carried off in a flash flood. I agree to this metaphor for indeed when you are in that moment, you feel nothing but the depression as if swept up in a current. We look for some kind of thought, ideal, or people to latch onto to save ourselves from our own runaway flood of feelings but more often than not we find nothing. 

Then its almost as if you are drowning in your own dark thinking like a person falling to the bottom of the sea where the monsters you created in your own head await. They are self-deprecation, self-loathing, and other things I can't think of but were made specifically to punish ourselves. For we feel we are not good enough for the world, for ourselves, or for those who care for us. For me it was the idea of the inevitable, the eventuality of being alone and not equipped to deal with such an occurrence. Once my parents are gone I will have no one, for I am a stranger in my own land. The thought of being a burden on others is horrid to me, of being completely useless. So to spare others the burden of dealing with me I determined that once that happens I will end myself to spare others the burden. So that they need not be constrained financially by me and to free myself from my own darkness. 

For when you are at the bottom of your own internal dark ocean, the pressures of all those thoughts and feelings coupled with the actual inability to feel anything...you just wish to die. Indeed it was not long ago that I checked on the closest gun store and found it was a 30 minute drive away. Being someone who studied the arts I knew I could easily pretend I was normal, go through the waiting period for I was patient enough, then when I finally have it probably go through the motions before ending it. For if I am destined to end up alone then death is preferred than living for the sake of living. 

But I am not at the point at the moment, but it is on my to do list should the worst come to pass. I've tried to shirk this fate, but my attempts have been for naught. I've grown tired of trying to fight it...its been with me all my life and now...I merely await an answer. An answer that will never come, for the meaning of life is subjective and only each person must find what it is for themselves. So if there is nothing no one can tell me that will keep me going, nor do I have the will to keep going, then all I am doing is just existing, waiting for the day it all ends. 

Anyway I apologize for the long post and if the mention of suicide was a bit much for some. I just needed to pen this down.

TL;DR, Depression is like a raging flood that swallows you up and brings you down to drown. While drowning you look for an answer that will never come because no one can give you a reason to struggle for breath. Only you yourself can, which if your will is weak or shattered makes it even more difficult. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Swept away into the dark...I await an answer

I am a trainee clinical psychologist undertaking research in relation to thoughts of suicide. The study is concerned with how people that struggle with low mood or anxiety do or don't develop thoughts of suicide. In that regard, I am hoping to recruit people that have **and** have not experienced thoughts of suicide, so anyone can participate. I have sought permission from an r/BPD moderator to post here. 

It is a questionnaire that takes approx 10-15 minutes to complete. The study is entirely anonymous and a draw for one of four £25 ($36) Amazon vouchers will be made for those that take part. I would really appreciate your participation and thank you advance to those that take part.

**Warning about potentially triggering questions**
The questionnaire asks some questions in relation to thoughts of suicide as mentioned above, but there also some questions regarding self-harm history. Further details are contained in the participant information sheet.

Not sure if this is the right place to post, so let me know if it's not. 

So my boyfriend and I started dating about three months ago. It's been pretty amazing so far - he's sweet, funny, and we really care about each other. Early into the relationship he told me he had severe depression and social anxiety, but he's been taking medication for a long time and seeing a psychologist, and it doesn't really affect our relationship. He does have bad days, but most of the time he's pretty cheerful and doesn't bring my mood down. 

However, the reason I'm asking this question is because around the same time we started getting serious, I started getting gradually more and more depressed. This was probably also due to work increasing at uni, but it seemed less like the stress was just getting to me and more like I might actually be depressed. 

I'd self-harmed for about a year before I met him and I've always had pretty bad self-esteem, and in the past I've also had short periods of time (maybe 1-2 weeks) where I felt depressed. But it's never been this severe, or this prolonged before. 

About three nights ago I was very, very close to attempting an overdose on painkillers before he managed to talk me into waiting, and even then I felt so low I sat in my room cutting for an hour (sorry if too much detail.) It's hard to remember the last time I felt really happy, or even a really strong emotion. Everything feels quite subdued and distant, and often it feels like there's a heavy weight on my chest. I'm going to see someone, but I don't know why my low mood won't go away this time.

So about three days ago my husband tells me he wants a divorce. Now, we've played this game before: he threatens that, I crack, he takes it back, things are okay again for another month maybe. Only difference is that this time around I decided enough was enough (okay I lied I decided that once before too but he convinced me to come back).
He's obviously not remotely affected by it, just keeps on doing whatever he wants without a care in the world. Probably thinking ""cool now I can be selfish and no one can call me out on it"" while he zones out to WoW.
Now me on the other hand: I'm going through my xanax prescription like candy just to keep myself from having a full blown panic attack. Totally out of my antidepressants as of today. Basically imagine a dumpster full of feral cats caught in a tornado and that's me.

I have a (very new, like not even got a first paycheck new) job. I have my own car. My parents and his parents are okay with helping me move out. But here's the kicker: I moved three states over for him with his parents so I have absolutely no one here AND I work for his mom.
Earlier today a coworker approached me and told me she noticed the signs of marital distress and that it was pretty obviously taking its toll on me. Naturally I confided in her that it's been rough trying to find a good apartment and figure out how to budget seeing as how I have no clue about anything about the area.

So I end up making an appointment to view a nice unit maybe a 15minute walk from my work. And when I casually mentioned to my inlaw that this coworker told me good places to rent (including the aforementioned unit) and where to get the cheapest groceries, she went off on me. Full force ""I wish you would have kept OUR business a secret now everyone knows MY business I'm so embarrassed for ME."" Basically telling me that I'm the worst person ever for wanting a friend and help in a time of extreme distress.

So I stand there and try not to cry while she goes on and on about how crap my choices are. I clock out. Get in my car. Take a deep breath. Drive to the unit and think ""okay I can do this"". I take the tour and tell the manager I'm interested. And as we're filling out paperwork she starts asking me if I'm married, what my husband does, ya know casual nice small talk.

And I just lose it. I start bawling telling her all about my issues, she kindly gives me my applicant fee back (probably scared shitless of my sudden outburst), and I sob hysterically all the way back home.

I've always avoided talking to my family about this and I have many excuses: I wasn't sure it even was depression (at least the first few years), I didn't want them to worry about me, I didn't want them to have a wrong feeling of guilt, I wanted them to be happy and that's easier for them if they think I'm doing fine.  
But even though that's all true I think the real reason was more selfish: I know I can't survive without their (financial, but way more important also emotional) support.

I know rationally that it's highly unlikely that they would react to me telling the truth by reducing or cutting their support. They are good people and have always been supportive, no matter how I behaved or whether they understood my actions. And I was a pretty difficult teenager.

But still, in my heart I feel at risk of loosing them in some way once the truth comes out. Even if there was just more emotional distance than there is already, I'm not sure if or how I could take it. (And I've starting crying a little writing these sentences.)

Now, since I'm still a college student and under the age limit, I'm still included in the family health insurance. And so the letter from the insurance (whether they would pay for the therapy based on my symptoms or not) came to my mother's address. She usually doesn't open mail addressed to me, but apparently after the last five or more letters only contained advertising stuff, she thought this one would be as well and she could open it.

She just hinted at this in a text and asked when I would be home visiting next. Which is next Friday or Saturday (my sister and I are going to dinner with our grandfather as a birthday present Saturday evening).  
So now I guess I should prepare myself for talking. But every time I think about it I'm close to tears and I don't know if I'll even be able to form a single coherent sentence.

I don't really expect any sort of advice or anybody to read this whole text. But I couldn't sleep and had to get this out somehow.

I am nearly 20 years old and have never had a significant other. No one's ever held my hand, no one's ever kissed me, no one's ever cared. I was at some kind of peace with this for the longest time. I hoped and hoped that would day someone would come along. But it never happened.
Seeing that it wasn't going to happen in the 'real world', I turned to the internet. There are tons of people on the internet! Someone must like me there! Perhaps someone would like me on Tinder or OkCupid?? So after creating some online profiles, I once again hoped that my loneliness would be put to sleep. A week later.... no likes, no visits, nothing. Perhaps I'm ugly? I never thought I was, but I'm beginning to have other ideas.
It's not the lack of physical contact that saddens me. It's the fact that no one has ever valued me -- it's quite an empty feeling.
As I sit here and type this, I'm faced with a decision: down a couple bottles of pills or continue living and growing old all alone. Time is against me. It may take 60years for someone to finally like me.
I've racked my brain for reasons to not kill myself this evening and I'm coming up blank. I simply cannot take the loneliness anymore.

Molested by my father, raised by a narcissistic mother with DID in squalor, starved, mind games telling me I was a horrible person from 4-5 years old. My mother frequently threatened that I'd wake up and she'd be gone over the first 20 years of my life. Sometimes she delivered on that promise. She'd hide things, pack bags like she was leaving, ignore me for weeks. I had to pull knives out of her hands when she was trying to kill herself. It was a nightmare.  

At my worst (around 13/14 years old) I was almost totally withdrawn and mute. It took me a long time to climb out of that hole. I'm 32 now. 

12 years ago I met my husband. We clicked almost immediately. I wasn't super physically attracted to him, but we got along so well. We moved in together almost immediately (partly due to my mom abandoning me again - she moved out and hadn't paid the bills in 2 months and I had nowhere else to go).

My husband and I went to college together. Grad school together. I found out I had PTSD in grad school and pretty much flunked out. I didn't tell him I had it. 5 years ago I became pregnant. We got married. We had our second kid. 

Our kids are now 4 and 1. Just the saturday before last he brought up wanting to try for a third child and I was totally on board. I thought how lucky was I? I have a devoted husband (though he's been distant in recent years and struggled with depression himself), get to stay at home with my babies, he brings in a comfortable salary so that our children aren't raised in poverty and we have a stable roof over our heads, our kids are being raised in a loving, functional environment. And most importantly I thought I'd never have to worry about losing our family unit. I was happy.

Tuesday all of that changed when he told me he wanted to be a woman. 

I've never fallen into darkness so fast before. 

The first two days I did nothing but cry and sleep. I thought I was getting better after that. I was having a few panic attacks a day, but I thought I was better. I could look at him. I could talk. I think I was just numb and in denial. 

He told me he wants to take this very slow to see how far he needs to take it. He's afraid of losing our family too. But last night he cried on my shoulder because he wanted to look 'nice' in clothes. He claims to have only found out a week before he told me, yet he's made so many small changes. Blow drying his hair. Doing his nails. Reading a LOT about hormone and surgery and voice training and name changes. 

Last night after he went to bed I stayed up and did something I shouldn't have. Something I had to do with my mom as a means for survival. I snooped. I looked through his reddit history and what I found scared me. In his posts before he told me, he seemed so gleeful in knowing he was trans. Incredibly happy. He talked as if he wanted to transition soon. He said he wanted to hopefully lose 50 more pounds before he started it. He had sworn to me he'd made no decisions. 

I stayed up most of the night crying. He found me at one point curled into a ball heaving in sobs. I told him I was having a hard time believing him. That there was no good way out of this situation. That I didn't want to be a joke in the community. Didn't want our children bullied. That I wanted to be married to a man.

I actually found myself strong enough to tell him what I'd done with snooping. He was mad at first but then still insisted he'd made no decisions. He said no matter what he'd support me and the kids, even if he had to get a second job. (I'm a stay at home mom, 5 years out of the workforce with a biology degree that will maybe give me $20-25K/year at most, he makes $100K a year.)

I wanted him to promise me he wouldn't choose transitioning over our family. I begged him to just go back to how our family was. I told him everyone always leaves and it's not fair. Why does this always fucking happen to me? I had thought I was safe and now I kind of feel like an idiot for feeling that way. 

My brain is so used to being stabbed in the back that it will not let me trust him. I can't think rationally. I keep breaking down in sobs randomly, and today I have felt so much anger. I yelled at my son for no reason. I have to keep very very strongly resisting the urge to break things. It's scaring me. 

I have absolutely no interest in anything. I don't want to go out and pretend I""m fine to people. I don't want to play with my children (this is heart wrenching to me). I don't want to eat. I have what should be such an exciting concert coming up with Paul McCartney (one of my absolute idols) and I just can not feel anything about it. Nothing. I hate feeling this way. I hate crying. But I feel like I hate everything else too. 

In my weakest moments I'm thinking very scary thoughts. Like, I'm done and I'm not talking about this relationship. I can't take this kind of pain in my life again. I don't want to be alone. Can it not be my turn anymore? I don't want to fight, I just want to give up. I haven't planned anything on hurting myself, it's just like my brain keeps nudging me that it's another option from all the other horrible options of living with a woman I""m not attracted to, being betrayed by my spouse, starting over as a single mom in possible poverty, living with an expiration date with my husband who continues to be a man until next year..or five years, or in ten years until he decides it's more important than us. I have no one. Local friends, but no family. No close friends. The only thing keeping me going is thinking of my children. And I am barely going. 

My husband seems very worried about me. I'm worried if I tell him about these thoughts he'll try to put me in patient or if we get divorced use it to take the kids from me. These feelings are completely related to this current situation and it's been years since I've felt anything like it. He's always been the nicest, most conscientious, thoughtful person. But he feels like a stranger. And this situation is SO MUCH like when my mom would abandon me. 

I'm meeting a therapist wednesday. It seems like a life time away. I've posted on support groups but they're just making me angry. It's almost all either 'you're husband is a freak divorce him asap' or 'you married him for him, not his gender, stay with him and you'll be happy because he's happy.' I met a friend face to face, but all of the support seems so superficial to me. I'm sure it's the depression but fuck. I feel so awful.

It seems to me that this is the case in some countries like the US but in other countries the patient is the one who requests abstracts, summaries or other such documents from old psychiatrists (or psychologists or other health practitioners).

**Do countries vary in this kind of practice?**

---

&amp;nbsp;

Some context:

**WARNING:** If you find what I'm about to say disrespectful, rude or violating the rules of the site, please just ignore it.

- I am moving to another country to work there. I visited that other country for a few days for a doctor's appointment with my new psychiatrist. I am currently back in my current country and am returning to that other country in a few weeks.

- My new psychiatrist doesn't want to prescribe me antidepressants even though I've been taking them for over half a year. This was based on the things I have told her in the limited time that we had.

**Isn't she supposed to ask my old psychiatrists or psychologists for records? I'm assuming the practice of medicine in this regard does not vary.**

- I might be screwed as I need these antidepressants to stop myself from being angry with my [narcissistic father](https://np.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4puzqb/if_ndad_shows_up_to_my_graduation_im_going_to/).

- I spoke to my current psychiatrist (a resident) about this, and he said:

1. He didn't ask any of my old psychiatrists anything because he didn't see the need to do it.

2. To the best of my memory, he also said that my new psychiatrist probably should ask him or my previous psychiatrists for medical records.

3. He said he might be able to make a note explaining [why he prescribed me antidepressants](https://np.reddit.com/r/antidepressants/comments/4m8fis/doctor_prescribed_me_antidepressants_but_didnt/), but I guess he would have to check with his boss.

4. Last time he said that based on his inquiries, medical records had to be requested by new doctor, but I have asked him to make more inquiries about variations in practice.

&amp;nbsp;

- Even with Ritalin, I seem to be having some **working memory problems particularly in conversations** both professionally and personally, although I know it would be worse without Ritalin.

&amp;nbsp;

- My doctor said he was expecting Ritalin was supposed to help with that. His thought is to **either increase the dose of my Ritalin or to change my Brintellix (i would go off Brintellix immediately) to an antipsychotic such as Seroquel or Abilify**. 

- The latter suggestion was under the idea that:

1. antipsychotics would provide me more dopamine or something. **I thought that's what methylphenidate (Ritalin) does because I thought ADHD is a dopamine deficiency problem, but apparently it's more on norepinephrine or something?**

2. Something like the antipsychotic would slow down sort of my brain which goes from one thought to another pretty fast.

Edit: He said ""flight of ideas"" which he describes as me trying to speak of one topic then in the middle of it I would be discussing another topic altogether. I said ""Yeah, haven't you noticed that I've been doing that a lot?"" He said he thought Ritalin would help with that and then suggested dopaminergic medication.

I looked it up. ""Flight of ideas"" is a bipolar thing specifically in [mania](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/4mwv9y/mania_vs_adhd/).

- Non-medically, his advice for me is to take breaks in the middle of conversations, which is pretty good advice actually.

I work 2 jobs in an attempt to keep my head above the constant loan and bill payments. When I'm not working, I'm just trying to stay numb.

That little voice that's in the back of everyone's head is always whispering to me. ""Just kill yourself,"" ""what's the point in trying you piece of shit,"" and ""obviously no girl could ever be interested in you, you're definitively a loser.""

That little voice just keeps getting louder. I try to keep reality in mind but anymore I find myself looking for reasons to stick around. The only reason I've really been able to find is my family. My friends and coworkers would be sad for a little bit but they would move on, but my family is another story. It would be devastating to them and I just couldn't do it to them. They're just so proud of what they think I am but I just know I'm a piece of shit and if they truly knew me, they would be thoroughly disappointed.

A little more, possibly relevant, backstory: I have been very christian my entire life up until a few months ago. When I had my beliefs, I thought that the feeling was normal and I should just live with it.

I think the being watched feeling isn't as prominent anymore, but now it's like this ""impending doom"" feeling is even stronger. I just can't shake this feeling that this is basically all a sick joke and that the more I work my way towards becoming happy, the more I'll start to run into horrible things and realize it was pointless like I always thought.

I haven't been able to. She's moving in with a relative out of town and I will be homeless. I have a cat that I found when she was a tiny kitten. I love the cat dearly. I don't know what I am going to do about the cat and it's breaking my heart knowing I have to get rid of her. I've been isolated for these several years, and by isolated I mean occasionally going to the grocery store. That's it. A few times I hung out with a friend but he committed suicide a few months ago.

My mother, on the other hand, doesn't concern me in the least. The fact that she will be out of my life is the only good thing about this. I know it sounds very cold and heartless but I won't miss her at all. I know it's part of the depression but at the same time, she has a bad prescription pill problem and she has always been very manipulative, guilt-tripping, conflict-oriented and often times emotionally abusive. When she's high on her meds, she is dangerous. It would take hours of writing for me to even summarize all the things she's done. I had to call an ambulance last month when I had had enough of her because she was coming close to doing something very dangerous again. She went through her Xanax refill within a few days! A month's worth of pills -- all gone. I don't know if it was her mental state at the time or if she was mad because I had called an ambulance, but she made allegations that I had struck her. I had to talk to a cop! I've never been in trouble so I was a little scared. The cop said within a few minutes of talking to me that it was clear my mom was either lying or in a state of confusion but still. My medication came up short this month and I suspect she might have stolen nearly half my refill. I don't know, because the pharmacy claimed they checked their stock but they shorted me once before. I caught it the same day that time, but this month, I noticed a week after I got my refill that it looked like I had far less than I should.

It was the 4th of July and I was stuck in my own thoughts and alone. The day was not even that bad of a day in comparison to others, but it was the day, so I suppose it was the worst.

I went through many months of hating that I woke up the next morning, absolutely hating everything about it. I was mad that I couldn't get the one thing I wanted right, I hated myself more for it. I did not tell anyone what I did besides one friend that I texted before to say goodbye. I did not think I was worth the help, so I didn't even seek medical help, all I did was wake up and go to work the next day like nothing happened even though I was dying on the inside. 

Something that lead me to the place that I found myself was that I could not admit that I was a drug addict and an alcoholic. I preferred drinking over the drug, but the drug was great for the times where I couldn't get drunk. I just thought there was not way I was 21 and this is what 21 year olds did. Putting down the drink was the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I faced many relapses and many break downs just because I couldn't drink. I only wanted the drink because of how sad I was, I didn't want to feel anything.  If I did not put down the drink there would be no way that you would be reading this now. 

My life today is great. Not perfect, but I can manage my symptoms unlike before. I still live with depression, anxiety, and BPD but I don't let them define me anymore. I have been sober for 6 months.

I remember that I used to love hanging out with them, and that they were amazing, but I don't have that anymore.

The youngest ones get along great.  They're energetic, they have fun, they don't need a purpose to anything, and they're easily entertained.  The oldest cousin and my sister get along amazingly.  They're calm, talk about whatever, and just enjoy each others presence.

And here I am, the oldest of them, hiding away in my room.  I don't want to talk with them, I don't want to play with them, I just want to be alone.  I hear them laughing downstairs, running around enjoying life, while I'm up here sitting in silence trying not to cry.

Everyone else in energetic, happy, doing what they love.  I haven't gone swimming with them because I'm self conscious about my body.  I haven't played with them because I find their entertainment idiotic.  All the while the ""adults"" are trying to force me to be with them, because ""they don't see us enough"".

Is this okay?  Do other people do this?  I want to be able to be mindless, to just have fun but I can't.  I want to throw my worries away but I can't.  I feel like I'm being a jackass to them, but I just can't stand them.  I'm the only one in my family who does this.  Everyone is outside, talking about their days, laughing and partying, and I'm sitting up here in my room wishing they'd stop.

I've been suicidal since I was 10 (now 17). I have had a recent surge in these thoughts after having escaped them for a year or two. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now, and I watched the two most depressing markiplier videos that exist. I haven't ever watched him. I've seen clips, I know of him, I just don't really watch youtubers. One of the videos was about a game about suicide, called The Static That Speaks My Name, and the other was a kinda PSA he made after his friend committed suicide. I decided to email him after watching them, because I just had to fucking tell him. Here's what I sent.

""Hi Mark! I wanted to let you know something that I hope will make your day.
Recently, I've been struggling. I've considered killing myself, and harming myself. A lot. I haven't attempted anything. I've come close, but never have, and I now never will. Because I just watched your video ""Lost a friend"", regarding Daniel.

I have never seen any of your videos, but The Static that speaks my name and lost a friend are the first 2 videos of yours I've ever watched! And at a time where I am thinking about doing such things. But your message at the end after you finished the game and, I must say, particularly your attempt at telling people about Daniel, have helped me. Because having seen clips of you at your peaks, seeing you sing about space being cool and all, I thought ""this guy is so happy!""

But then I seen you try and talk but fail as your voice cracked and dissipated. And I realised, after seeing that, that even someone as strong and joyful as you could be broken by the suicide of a close friend.

So no. I'm not going to attempt it. Because I can't, I just fucking can't put my friends through that. I can't bear the thought of my friends trying to tell someone about it and being unable to. I can't bear the thought of not being able to help my friends because I'm not here. I'm sitting here crying my eyes out as I type this, but I have to tell you, or it will eat me up inside.

Markiplier, you saved my life. You weren't the only person to have done so, but you were one of them. A link in the chain that pulled me out of the pits of despair long enough to see that I can't let myself slip. So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. If you want to, feel free to share this message with people. Maybe other people like me will show up.

I feel I've been given this life without a choice. I was never truly meant to be born into this world and now I have to drag my feet through it all.
at the age of 22 I've been ""you're too young to even think those sort of ways"" ""Life is too precious to give up"" ""You're still young, you can do it"" But are those words true and genuine?

I'm Mentally/Emotionally and of somewhat physically disabled. I was 18 years old when my mother left me. I didn't have anyone to lean on after that, yes I do have my step father and my half sister and not to mention the rest of my family to give me support but I can only take so much of this internal pain I have.

I was given government money for my disabilities or other known as ""SSDI"" or Social Security Disability Income. I was young and naive and wasn't sat down and told what I should really do with it. after the course of years being able to have that to help me, Social security took it and told me I have ""lack of documents for my disabilites"" I have documents that date back in 1996.

There have been places I've been sent to for professional help and facilities that have a group of people who have similar problems, I've been sent there many times from the age of 13 years old to 16 years old at those times, Due to being sent to a place called 'Pine Rest' was because I was always suicidal and evaluated me there as a in-patient. after all that.. I'm still the same way as I was when I was younger.
I have Major Depression, High anxiety, Very claustrophobic, panic attacks, ASD ""Autistic spectrum disorder"", Functional Limb Weakness, Suicidal thoughts, black outs, Cognitive Impairment, those are some of the things I suffer from.

I've had Cancer and 2 strokes when I was a baby. I've gone through chemotherapy and radiation. Those factors make a huge toll on you and it can affect your life drastically.
I've graduated from high school but I don't have a diploma, but a Certificate of Completion.. and with having that I can't get into any college... I've tried going for a GED but I was scored ""under average"" and they took about over $200 of my money as well..

Social security sends me countless notices that I have to pay $12,000 dollars, in which I do not have at all. I even struggle with trying to find a job to pay that..
I've done over 90 applications and I've only gotten 1 interview. I've been having major depression over this and I've been trying to file for an appeal for SSDI back. I've learned of my mistakes back then and I want to be able to support myself properly..

I've been thinking about making a waiver for the money I don't have but I'm scared that they will decline my waiver and yet they think I can work a full-time, 7 days a week job. I can't because I suffer from a lot of my limitations. I can only do maybe 2 days out of a week and 4-5 hours of work for those 2 days.
I just don't know what to do.. I'm disabled and I can't even find a job, being a young person and dealing with all this on my shoulders really hurts me especially mentally.
It's hard for young people to find a job, it's even harder for people like myself to get a job and I'm left with nothing 
truly...

I just want my life to end, I feel worthless, a dead beat to society, a helpless nobody, Someone with no value at all to life, waste of life and blood, a mockery to the human race.. I can't deal with this and I'm struggling so much and with no money coming in.. I just feel if I take my life, I won't have to suffer through this. It's better to end your life because it's more easier but to live your life everyday is painful and miserable.
I've been starving myself for the past few weeks, with only eating little by having some dinner and that's all because of my depression sinks into my head and with only dark clouds of negativity. I've lost my appetite due to it and I'm wasting away..

I want nothing more than my life to be ended so I can feel at peace and be with my mother again. She was the only one who truly known who I was and what I've gone through because. She's my mom and without her I can't go on anymore..
I've tried to kill myself countless times but that was when I was younger and I didn't get a %100 success rate due to failing or my mom/dad stopping it..

The suicidal/self harm things I've done to myself were.. Burn my skin, Overdose on pain killers, tried to hang myself, tried to drink cyanide, Cut my wrist, swallow foreign objects, tried to jump off buildings.. those are but few I've attempted to do..

im honestly very scared of these feelings because i used to be so sure and so content about my space and my social life not too long ago. the single best way i can explain it is, i feel like im losing myself, that im lost somewhere in here and cant find my way back out.

No friends, no boyfriend, never been kissed, never had a job but damn I tried. I just had a very serious surgery 3 months ago, and as I'm barely recovering ish is already hitting the fan. I was a bullied child, high IQ, big discrepancy between verbal and spatial (talked at like 6 months, walked kinda funny for a while and later got better).

I recently learned I'm now a candidate for being autistic (Aspie).

My father assaulted me back in October 2015 and ""woke up"" a sprained wrist that had just healed. Pain ensued for months, and I'm still scared to use my wrist, though it seems fine. I heal real slow, always have.

I moved to my grandmother's house after that with my mom. I don't get along with my grandmother. She puts me down because I have phobias and GAD and she also puts me down for being allergic to peanuts and other things ""but you never WANT to eat anything you picky eater, stop it"". She mocks me when she sees that I'm scared of something. She yelled at me once during a panic attack...

She guilt trips me over lots of stuff, so with my mom we decided I'd move to my own apartment.

Now my mom guilt trips me for not wanting to live with ""her"", well okay but my father has freaking PSYCHOSIS and has assaulted me so maybe I don't feel safe? She's okay with being yelled at and threatened verbally.

I've been on newer generations anti-depressants and benzos. They helped me tons and have turned my life around... but the progress isn't sufficient.

I'm jobless but have a BA in English because I had to quit school several times for health issues (physical and psychological).

If I factor in the time spent in the ER, this year I think I was in hospital for a month. I've been in pain ever since but my stomach pain is now maybe 3 or 4, was 7 with morphine before now I don't take anything.

Every time I think things are better they get worse.

A week ago I almost fell and effed up my back again, it's been hurting since, getting slightly better but then I got a giant canker sore in my mouth which seems to be spreading. And then it gets better and...

    more tensions with my father over the fact that he's... manipulative and passive-aggressive and now just aggressive. He guilt trips me and my mom and lets us do everything. I mean he barely helped with the move to my new apartment but even when he does help it's for an ulterior motive.

    I had an argument with my aunt over the phone and I don't even know what I said apart from ""well if you're busy just hang up I understand"" at the end because she was telling me I was tiring and manipulating everybody (not...).

    My mom wants me to get a driver's license. I wanted that too but the teacher at the schools (tried several) always says I'm so dangerous to myself and others when I drive that maybe it's not worth it. Yes I did almost run over several people. It's probably my undiagnosed autism. It's NOT my fault. I'm doing my very best...

    Then she says I should be a translator and why haven't I found a job yet as a translator I could do it on the computer I'm good with computers blah blah blah. Hum hello, I tried. For hundreds of hours.

    Currently the only money that comes in is some royalties from books I wrote before the wrist injury. And I was that desperate for money that I ended up writing erotica when I saw non-fiction wasn't selling anymore. I'm a virgin. And I wrote erotica. Frankly if that's what it takes for me to make a living... I don't know.

I have trouble sleeping again. One of my only real hobbies is gaming, ""intellectual"" games, well at least partly, and of course, English, though now that I know how to speak it it's more of a tool.

I feel like everything I try to do it's just because I think it will land me a job and it doesn't, even hobbies that I pick up like knitting or drawing.

I'm not sure I can make a living on the internet, unless I'm fine with being the new erotica queen.

I'm still tired from the surgery and yesterday when I went to my new apartment with my mom, I was alone in the car temporarily. A bunch of rowdy teenagers walked toward the car, and the boss of the group said something along the lines of ""Hey you"". I ignored him and he stuck his face to the car window and said ""Wow how ugly are you"".

I still have some PTSD left from my father's assault. I don't care about what he said, and my mom chased him afterward and we both told him we'd press charges. And we will if he does that again.

However, he was way too close to me and that woke up my PTSD. I know have those nightmares again in which I scream bloody murder and wake up the whole house.

I'm about ready to kill myself or take antidepressants.

No car, no job, a place to live that has a door that's very heavy (possibly to heavy to push/pull after an operation). A grandmother who treats me like I'm four, an abusive father, bad health, no life prospects. Still struggling with rather basic things like going out to the store or cooking for myself though I'm getting better at that and can do it but the buses in my city are inconvenient. I'm terrified of going out as these violent kids are in the neighborhood and will they gang up on me if they see me alone again even if we told them we'd fight back.

A friend of mine, not really a friend because she doesn't understand me but she tries to, is angry at me because I can't go to the restaurant and do stuff with her.

As I'm typing I'm scared for my wrist but I think it's healed. I hope it really is.

I don't understand why people are cruel and judgemental and won't hire me just because I look like I'm 13 or I've never had a real job. I really think it's the underage look part. But I've been a translator once, an English tutor several times, and a non-fiction and ahem erotica writer. And over the phone I do fantastic. If people didn't see me I'd be fine. I have health issues but I've been complimented many times on my English. I just want to become a bilingual secretary and spend the rest of my life somewhere CALM.

Make money, be satisfied with myself, relax, then die.

Sure if I could I'd make a living on the internet but I don't think I can.

People tend to not like me because I'm different. Can't do anything about that and I'm not about to use make up or dress like a whore to please them. I feel too stupid when I try.

Nobody wants me. Everybody has something critical to say to me. I think I don't have the energy to try and love myself anymore.

What to do?

And no, it didn't help that my mom said ""stay with me and my dad forever it will cost less money and you can do so little anyway you need the help"".

Maybe I do need some help right now, but I've lived almost entirely independently before. If this goes on I'll start hoping my next health issue kills me. The last one almost did 3 months ago.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Please could you give me advice I want everything to end

I've lost so many friends the last year and I have no one to talk to. I've wished I was dead so many times and I always feel better after talking about it, but my ""friends"" have recently implemented a ""don't ask don't tell rule"".

Me looking for comfort is too exhausting for them. I feel like such a failure as a person and I don't know what to do. I've been idealizing suicide since I was 7 years old and I'm so tired of it. I'm so tired of trying. I can't talk to anyone. Acquaintances would be weirded out, my friends told me point blank ""just tell it to the internet, we don't want to hear it anymore"", and when I tried to tell my boyfriend about it, the next day all he could say was ""do you know how scary and sad that was for me?"" like I can't even try to get help without inconveniencing/alienating someone. I want to feel better, and I've been trying so hard.

 I've tried so many drugs; Prozac, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, Seroquel, Celexa, Klonopin, Trazodone, Ativan, and I'm currently on Latuda, but none of it seemed to help. Eventually I'd feel the same way I do now. I feel like all these drugs were just placebo effects and I could trick myself into thinking I was better but I really wasn't. I forced my self to get and actually go to a job, I purposefully planned things for the future so I could have something to look forward to; I worked really hard to eliminate self deprecating jokes from my vocabulary. Point is, I'm really trying. I feel as though I've advocated for myself in so many different ways and have still ended up no better. Nothing is working. 

Things aren't fun anymore, and I have a hard time pretending they are. I used to love TV but now I can hardly zone out. I just feel so alone. It's so hard to make friends now that I'm out of school. Even the friendships I've had don't last.

 I thought I had found my ""forever friend family"" in college, but Wellbutrin caused me to go manic and I tried to kill myself. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for a week and when I got out, all my friends were going on and on about how difficult that week was for them because they were so worried, and I called them out on it. I wish to god that I hadn't. I'd give anything to go back and redo February of 2015. If I had just let them say whatever and not challenge them on it maybe I could still have friends, maybe I could be happy. But I did and I'm not. I have so many regrets. And I can't do anything about it. I wish I was literally anyone else but me. But now I'm an overweight (courtesy of Seroquel) college drop out (courtesy of the mental breakdown after the fallout of that friend group) who is going no where.

Talking to my bio family is not an option. My aunt and my grandfather on my dad's side both committed suicide (funny how it's so obvious mental illness runs in the family but no one can empathize) so it's a touchy subject. My college forced me to contact my dad after I was hospitalized and the first thing he told me is that he was going to pull my tuition because I obviously couldn't hack it. It kills me to know that I'm a disappointment to my father. I have no one to talk to. I'm losing my mind and I'm so alone. 

My friend, one of the people who put in the don't ask don't tell rule, is a good depressed person. Let's call her Satine. She's been to more psychiatric hospitals than I have but her life is fucking great. Her friends love her and are always like ""please talk to me if something is wrong uwu!!"" but she never does. Her way of depression is to go ""I'm depressed, I'm going to play Mass Effect!"" and everyone eats it up. I don't know how she does it. How can she supposedly feel the same way I do but doesn't have breakdowns or have relationships crumble around her? Her family is so supportive and revolve their entire life around when she goes into the hospital and I don't know what I'm doing wrong in comparison. How do I be a good depressed person like her?

I'm sorry if I'm rambling. There's just no one IRL who I can talk about this with. I can't even tell my psychiatrist, she'd just put me in the hospital and it would be last year all over again. I'm tired of being like this. I just want to feel like I matter. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,I don't know how to be a good depressed person.

I am a 16 year old guy, idk if I am allowed to say that but I don't care. So let me just get into the reasons.

First of all, I'm on vacation right now with family, and its making things even worse, since I cant see friends at all, and have to deal with my family who I literally despise.

I'll say what I have going for me in my life first.
1. My family is super privileged. We have 3 houses, I am an only child, pretty much get most of what I want materially.
2. I am pretty smart, attractive, funny, well liked(for the most part), and good at my activities.
3. When life is good, its normally great. I really enjoy myself when I am having a good time

Now for the reasons I may seriously commit suicide...
1. My parents and their rules... So anyway, I used to smoke pot a lot. I got caught by them and they flipped. They drug tested me, and still do months later. I figured out a way to pass them, but got caught again in the act of smoking, and have since quit. Basically, due to being caught I have been on/off grounded, not able to get my drivers license, and have had a lot of restrictions, added pressure, and feeling like they are just plain disappointed in me.
2. Friends: I have grown distant from a lot of my friends since school got out. THis is because I can't go out and chill with them much, and a lot of them still party all the time and I cant too often. (Don't say ""make new friends"", literally 75% of the people at my schoolthat I could even deal with and hang out with all smoke and drink, almost everyone does) It also pisses me off that most of my friends parents are clueless, or don't care enough to stop them. This feels soooo unfair, since they get the best of both worlds... I live in a wealthy town, so it's not like their parents are nobodies and they don't get all the same privileges I do.

3. This girl I like:
I have been talking to this girl from my school since early april. We were acquaintances at school, and than chilled a few times at a party and started snapchatting and texting. We haven't hung out in person in probably 2 months. She is a year younger, and can't drive. If I had my fucking license, I could take her on dates and what not. I believe having a girlfriend would make my life a lot better since it would give me a new, legal source of having fun. But the issue is I know I am, or have run out of time. She is super popular in her grade, and I am above average popular in mine. SO a ton of guys go after her, and she's fucking HOT! She has hooked up with a bunch of guys since we became close, and we haven't even hooked up, just talked about it. This is because I never see her! And I can tell she has lost interest, since I normally always start convos, or she will just start one and than break it off quick,

4. Since I have gotten depressed, I know things are just gonna get worse. My parents get pissed even easier now, and are always super suspicious. I don't want to be around my family at all on this vacation, and because of that my mom constantly has bitched at me for that, and always just says I am just digging a bigger hole for myself. It is just such bullshit, I literally do normal shit no parents care about and they flip shit! And that is why I still don't have my license and freedom back, even though I am not partying or smoking anymore. Such bullshit, I just want to tie the god damn noose right now, send some people a text or just put on my snapchat story and twitter ""killing myself rnow hmu for last words"" I'm wondering if I should tell anyone how I am feeling (Girl, Parents, Homies, etc,)

I feel hopeless and down a lot of the time. I'm not a stranger to being sad or lonely.

The one thing that keeps me down is the fact that I am constantly injured. I'm trying to become a firefighter and I'm already well behind my career goals from mostly being injured... Right now my arm is in a sling, I think I broke my collar bone because of some drunk asshole on the 4th falling on me while I was going down the stairs. I was celebrating my 3rd year of recovering from a spinal cord injury (someone pushed me in a boat), an injury that put me in bed rest for months and funny enough 2.5 years without going into anaphylaxis (A waiter did not listen to my allergy).

I'm tired of being injured, even in Scouts and High school they called me ""Crippled Craig."" I'm in my mid 20's and people still call me that, I just can't take being injured any more.

I'm missing work today because of my shoulder, its just another set back. I asked a girl to a music festival and she bailed last minute, I've been head over heels for her for over a year, I'm lonely depressed and injured again.

I post on here semi-regularly, so I'm sorry if I repeat myself.

I've completely lost control of myself and my life. I have no-one to talk to bar my family, and they don't understand what I'm going through (I've tried explaining).

I have no friends. All the people I met in college either want nothing to do with me or have moved on and are too busy to talk. I feel unbearably lonely most of the day. All the hobbies I have are all that distracts me from how pointless my life is.

All I have to look forward to each week is making a radio show no-one listens to (I get about 3 listeners each week) and going to creative writing and art classes with other mentally ill people. I get no fulfillment out of any of it, and often I wish I could just stop existing.

I can't see any point of living if I have no friends. I need it more than anything, and I've tried every way to get them (joining groups, going to clubs and bars, online forums). I don't need close friends, just people who I feel comfortable around and I can talk to about my interests.

Biting always was my thing; has been since about the age of six. I'm 23 now. I'm also living with my parents because I'm too chickenshit scared to move out, and lately my dad has been absolutely going in on me; pointing out how much of a fatass piece of shit that I am, that at the rate I'm going I'll never amount to anything, that I should just *be a man.* Meanwhile, I've spent at least a couple of hours every night for the past year or so now being terrified of every single car that drives by at night, terrified for my life, terrified that they're gonna be the people that kick down my door and kill my family right in front of my eyes or something.

Earlier my dad ""asked"" (which in reality means threats) me to find this knife he apparently lost while he was mowing, and that he ""expected"" it to be found by the time he got back. He said it was either in our yard or our neighbor's yard, both of which add up to about 1500 square feet. I spend about two hours in 100F+ weather trying to find it, all to no avail, until my mom basically forces me to come back in side for the sake of my health (at that point I was barely able to walk without stumbling). I'm fine from that now, but sometime in the middle of that, I took the keys in my pocket and just started slashing. There wasn't much blood, but still; something I thought I'd never do, I ended up doing. Either way, considering I didn't meet his ""expectations,"" I'm expecting a pretty unpleasant night.

&gt;Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015

&gt;This bill creates the position of Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders to take over the responsibilities of the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Mental health programs are extended and training regarding mental health is expanded. **[AKA let's rework the title of the current head of the most affected organization to make it less glamorous sounding so we can cut their pay while we give them way more work to do--that sounds** ***smart*** **guys]**

&gt;SAMHSA must establish the National Mental Health Policy Laboratory and the Interagency Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee. **[Interagency communication could lead to some big improvements]**

&gt;This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the National Institute of Mental Health to translate evidence-based interventions and the best available science into systems of care. **[They weren't already trying to do that? Was congress just doing that much to get in the way--I'll read this section in detail to learn why they're doing this and could probably learn a lot]**

&gt;Certain mental health care professional volunteers are provided liability protection. **[Probably a good thing, especially if it incentivizes more workers to give us options and lower costs]**

&gt;Pediatric mental health subspecialists are eligible for National Health Service Corps programs.

&gt;An underserved population of children or a site for training in child psychiatry can be designated as a health professional shortage area. **[Are we sure we want to be doing more to encourage giving psychotropic drugs to children? They deserve the chance to grow up healthy and happy, but this kind of feels like encouraging heavy-duty treatment before focusing on other interventions]**

&gt;The protected health information of an individual with a serious mental illness may be disclosed to a caregiver under certain conditions. **[Depending on the conditions, this could be a good thing. It could also be a horrible thing, especially in places with more severe stigma and unsupportive families]**

&gt;This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSAct) to conditionally expand coverage of mental health services.

&gt;Part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the SSAct is amended *to require coverage of antidepressants and antipsychotics*. **[Requiring coverage for APs is a HUGE deal]**

&gt; If it will not increase Medicare spending, Medicare's 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric hospital services is eliminated. **[It will be difficult to make it not increase spending. The only way I see this working out is if someone uses myopic data for health outcomes research predictions]**

&gt; Health information technology activities and incentives are expanded to include certain mental health and substance abuse professionals and facilities.

&gt; This bill restricts the lobbying and counseling activities of protection and advocacy systems **[presumably including NAMI &amp; DBSA, which sounds like a terrible thing]** for individuals with mental illness. These systems must focus on safeguarding the rights of individuals with mental illness to be free from abuse and neglect.",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,Mental Health Reform Bill supposed to have passed the house.

Road Builder - Trying to help |
    Drivers - Depressed
   
   Someone could be building a road out of wood to help people in cars to start moving places because the default terrain is rough. But the people in cars want something safer because they know wood won't hold their car. The people in cars don't know what would be better than wood, but know that wood won't hold the cars efficiently.  The person building the road insist that it's OK because they have seen motorcycles with Grade A tires travel across wood all the time.
   The people in cars start driving on wood roads, but the wood is puncturing their tires. They know something is wrong with their car and no one else seems to know. Unless someone inspects their car and has had a similar experience and expertise than they could offer solutions that make sense. Solutions could be making the road out of different materials and constantly changing those materials until something feels OK enough to ride, which could be be gravel/asphalt.

I understand that people's intentions are to help and sometimes they help, but it doesn't at times. A person might want to build a house out of bricks and someone might help by putting rocks on top of the bricks to help build the house. The intention to help is their, but realistically doesn't help the house builder.

I've been dealing with this on my own, because other people don't really seem to care or don't/feel too awkward to talk about what happened to me

I was walking home, 20 metres from my house and within a second I was suddenly on the ground, really confused to how I got there. To cut a long story short, I was attacked and held at knifepoint etc etc 

This happened at the end of February and on that day I was celebrating my birthday (on my own haha oh god) so this was pretty grim ending to a really good day out in the capital 

I couldn't tell you what I did in those first couple of days afterwards. I have absolutely no recollection, no idea. The days just went by me but ever since that night they've been with me always 

Since then, I've had my ups and downs. I'm generally okay if I'm careful. I take another route home 99% of the time but I can't be outside when it's dark or I'll panic, and I'll panic if someone's walking too closely behind me because the last thing I heard before it happened is the sound of someone walking behind me 

I can still hear my own screaming in my dreams (nightmares?) which is pretty horrible and I don't have anyone to talk about it to - I'm on a long waiting list for therapy, my mum gets too upset and doesn't know what to say and siblings and friends are acting like it never happened to me 

Today was so horrible. Constant panic, replaying of memories in my head, a lot of crying. I'm so emotionally exhausted and writing it out doesn't do anything for me. I'm so lonely :(

I feel really alienated, like I'm on one side and the world is on the other. Am I crazy to feel like this? I just feel so disconnected, unattached because it's just me fighting this alone 

I found this quote today which sums this up: ""Often it isn’t the initiating trauma that creates seemingly insurmountable pain, but the lack of support after.”

I've been working on changing my health and my fitness following a really long stint of depression and self hatred that lasted 4 years. - I never had any friends, I could never say I was truly happy. I had a broken childhood, a shattered family and to top it all off I'm an Aspie. Something that I still really really hate about my life and the cards I've been dealt.

I was let down for the umpteenth time by a ""friend"" who used me, and it destroyed me 4 months ago. 

I started to workout, in an attempt to sort my health out, and I ended up losing around 28 kilos since I started, and I started to have aspirations to start bodybuilding. In my time during this, lots of people started to talk to me, and two people in particular have been really supportive. 

But I look at the mirror and I hate what I see. I've got no definition, and I've not been able to see any coherent difference in my physique. Many people tell me I've changed but I can't see it. 

I also think that these people are all going to stab me in the back.

My mother was diagnosed with clinical depression in the 90s and still needs help from an antidepressant every now and then. My maternal grandmother, while never diagnosed (not much mental health info in 1960s India), was in a terrible marriage and killed herself out of unhappiness at 34.

My family history would lead you to believe I'm depressed off the bat, but hear me out. Personally, I've always been a bit morbid, cynical, and pessimistic in my thinking, but I am also always very happy, energetic, and easy to laugh. 

My main issue is that lately, life feels rather pointless. There doesn't seem to be much of a goal after getting into college (I'm a rising junior in college) so I have nothing really to work for. People say I should be working toward a career but I'm doing that already, and it's not very fulfilling. My issue seems to be that the ""goals""  (wife, kids, house, job, picket fence, etc.) that other people have don't appeal to me much, nor does working for the rest of my life for any reason.

This is where the ""depression"" part comes in. Most days I don't feel sad or anything, but there's always a tugging voice in the back of mind saying ""Is this all really worth it? Wouldn't it be much better to just become a bum and ride the rails until you die? Wouldn't it be much better to just kill yourself and be done with it all?"". These thoughts have been in the back of my mind since I was 13 (yes, 13), and though I've never followed through, it seemed to become a better and better idea as I got older. Now, I think every day of dropping out of college and backpacking all over America, or of taking a one way ticket to Thailand. I never thought that suicide was a good idea, but really the only thing keeping me from it now is the pain and the lack of effective methods. 

Like I said, I've had these thoughts since I was 13, but only recently have they begun to seem like an actual better alternative to my life, which is why I'm getting worried that I'm actually genetically/chemically depressed. Almost every day I feel very happy and confident, and yet I still have these nagging thoughts. I used to think that I was just lazy, but I couldn't have gotten to where I am now by being lazy. 

The only things that make me truly happy anymore are the little things: Coffee and cake in the park on a sunny day, reading a good book, talking and laughing with friends, wake n bake on a sunday morning, and other trivial things.

 I think my bipolar II has been cured. I mean I think I cured it just by trying my best to be better and spending time outside and going to church. When I was ill I never wanted to go to church but I've felt really drawn to it recently. Now it's great because I can see God in everything - the flowers like flames and the green green grass and the tiny plants that force their way up the cracks in the concrete. 

 Anyway has anyone else experienced this? That simply through thought and strength of mind, everything can get so so much better? The world exists for me to stride across it and enjoy it and experience as much of it as possible. And I think it's so amazing that I've basically cured myself; I've not needed meds for a while and I feel so much better and so much less sluggish. My mind is like lightning. This is how I am meant to be. 

I'm not saying of course that other people should do this because I think it depends on the person, but it's all okay. For me what makes me feel better is: sunshine, sleeping well, eating right. So  I just wanted to remind people that those are really really good things. :)

I'm an 18 year old guy who just graduated high school, so I forgive my poor ability to articulate my emotions, but here I go. Let me start with some background; I grew up in an upper middle class home, good family (aside from the fact that my parents divorced this year, but even that wasn't too bad), going to a great university, fairly social, nothing to complain about what so ever. Despite this, and this is what I really hate, I am finding myself feeling completely empty/sad. Throughout all of high school I would just put my nose down and do my school work and power through everything. This is what I used to deal with my parents splitting this year, and it seemed to work well emotionally and scholastically. But I digress, I first noticed this feeling maybe 6 months ago, when I gained feelings for a close female friend who I had rejected a relationship with in the past. I speak to her everyday, and am just reminded of how stupid I am for not pursuing anything with her when she wanted to. But thats life and all that jazz. She is now my only confidant in my feelings which I guess is good for talking things out.

Anyway, here is where the confusion comes in. To be honest, I think about suicide and death a lot, but every time I do I feel as though I'm only thinking about it for attention. The one thing I do not want to be is one of those people who fakes conditions for attention, yet I cannot judge whether I myself am feeling this way as a desperate cry for sympathy. I'm not sure if someone else has felt this way because I feel like a complete weirdo/jerk, and I still can't put this feeling into words. Oh, and last thing, I have always been the jokester, positive guy in my group, so I feel as though not a single person I know could understand me (Ugh I sound like such a typical teenager).

**Tl;dr**: On the outside I guess I look happy and successful, on the inside like a blank piece of paper. Are suicidal/ depressive thoughts just me calling for attention? Am I just being a dick to people with real problems?

I'm blind with anger right now. I'm so fucking done with life. It feels like things keep getting worse and worse.

I struggle to find passion in anything lately. Summer of last year I was planning to propose to my now ex. Before I bought the ring though, she had come to visit (we had been long distance for quite some time).

She raped me the weekend she visited. We had agreed to wait until marriage to have sex but she kept pushing for it. (Religious and personal reasons for wanting to wait, please don't judge on this decision.) I've read so much about ""women can't rape men"" but it's fucking bullshit. I was always taught to not hit a woman so when she hit me and forced herself on me I didn't know what to do. I was crying and begged her to stop. She didn't until I pushed her off and left to go for a walk. 

I know it sounds stupid. I feel like an idiot. It's my fault isn't it? I don't know anymore.

I broke up with her a month later. She told her friends and family how terrible of a guy I was and made up lies about me (e.g. saying I cheated on her, hurt her, etc.). Found out towards the end of our relationship that she had been cheating on me for the entire year and a half we were together. (She ""confessed"" a few days after forcing herself on me.)

Fast forward a year, to this summer. I recently went to a wedding where the bride was an ex- of mine, and the groom was an old friend. At first I was confused why I got an invite, but accepted begrudgingly since a few old friends were also going and we made a road-trip out of it.

At the wedding, her family and friends start telling stories about the groom. These stories were about me, but she had replaced my name with his. Long story short with this, I later found out that she had been seeing him for the entirety of our relationship a few years ago. They openly admitted to me that she cheated on me with him and left it at that. No apology. Should I have asked for one? Confronted them? Told someone? Left the wedding? I just shouldn't have gone I think.

I am currently working two jobs, upwards of 60-70 hours a week. My free time is spent doing odd jobs to make ends meet. I have a Bachelor's degree but can't get a job that pays more than minimum. Am I just not being picky enough? My friends all make more than I do, most of them double if not more. 

All I've ever wanted was to get married and have a family. My friends are getting married and I'm the last single one. Do I need new friends? Is my perspective just off?

am unmedicated currently (went off quetiapine/seroquel a while ago beecause of weight gain and horrible zombie feelings) and feeling good etc etc. I am not hypomanic or manic and I don't think my doctor has the right diagnosis. I think to be honest, I know more than he does about the whole thing because he can't see my brain and the links and the leaps in my head.

i'm watching a doc called Being Bipolar and there's a dr in it Dr Joanna Moncrieff and she says that bipolar might not have a biological cause; the narrator then mentions a “growing suspicion that the symptoms each person develops are a result of their life experiences”.
80% of people with bipolar, according to the documentary, take meds - so 20% don't.

I think it is better for me to feel the intensity of emotions, to look at the sun and feel it shining for me or to hear the wind in the trees and hear every note of the rustling leaves. The world is so so lovely! Quetiapine made me numb to that, and half asleep all the time, slurring my words and struggling to walk. I don't want to be like that. If I am going to be a success in life I simply can't afford to do that - I can't work two jobs and earn money and write novels when I'm half asleep, can I ? So for me it just makes sense. The other day I was thinking that maybe I should take the pills again but then I don't want the drugs in my brain. I don't trust them and what they will do to my head, and since I've been Googling about them it all seems to be a big thing to make me take meds to hide the truth of the world from me.

So, in summary of this long and rambling post, is anybody else unmedicated? I don't want anything negative to be said really because it's positivity that makes people thrive and strive to be healthy by following all those tips for a healthy life like sleeping properly.
Sleeping is boring though obviously and a bit of a waste f time - do people really?! need eight hours a night? I read that that's not true. Like the whole 2 litres of water a day thing. Arbitrary numbers.

Im honest with myself and my friends (as a friend) but am a lie in general. Im the life of the party, but I just ""am"". I feel so alone. Im 32, and I just exist. Everything that seems to happen in my life that is a positive thing leads to not working out. I always feel like 1 step forward, 2 steps back - sorry to sound cliched.

these moments, but they do happen.

I had a surgery to pin my ears back a year ago. My ears went in the right amount and I was happy but one of my ears was crumpled up and looked weird. I could live with this... But as the ears relaxed over the year the two ears started looking more and more asymmetric until I was embarassed to be seen because it was obvious I'd had work done, and the deformity on the right side looked more and more obvious.

So I went back for another operation. I was mostly upset with the protrusion of the normal ear after it relaxed. But putting it back would mean leaving the right ear deformed for life and even moving it back a bit to make the deformity even worse. PLUS I would have slightly risked ending up with a weird looking left ear too.

So instead I got the right ear fixed to look like the other one that looks a bit too far out.

Now it looks like a human ear again but both of my ears stick out a bit too much :(... I feel so depressed because I was happy with how the result looked last time I had it done and felt happy and confident about my ears for the first time in my life. I thought I could finally move on with my life. Now it feels like it's all been taken away from me!!!! :( but I couldn't take paying to get the ear purposefully deformed again and the deformity did bother me a bit... Plus I couldn't tell whether it made my head look too narrow having them close to my head. I'm feeling serious grief though, I feel like I lost a part of myself. The ears aren't out DRAMATICALLY now, but more than ideal.

I'm also not sure how the right ear now matches the left side it might still look in more or perhaps out more it's so, so, so stressful.

I can't have any more operations I don't think because I've had 3 now. Plus I can't take the stress of it all... I've felt suicidal after two of the surgeries and may still be suicidal if it looks uneven and Dumbo-esque when the bandage is off.

A struggle I suspect all too many of us struggle with.

The struggle of bipolar self esteem; balancing humility against arrogant grandiosity, realism against cognitive distortions, self-degradation and depression against pompousness and mania.

Being a compliment I've received dozens of times, it's probably one that has truth to it. But I realize that sometimes, such as when my summer manias are most apt to manifest, I have to put in serious mental effort from believing the compliment *too* well. How in depression I will find myself doubting the compliment's validity, but when I feel well I can get [absurdly overconfident](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/3le2on/manic_thoughts_im_wise_wise_as_shit/).

Today I'm making an effort to remind myself that the compliment is true but not endlessly true. To remind myself I am flawed, my strengths finite, and my weaknesses many. But also that **that's okay**. Because I still have those strengths, and other people's strengths are also finite, just differently so.

Today I accomplished with some difficulty something that was impossible for me to bring myself to do a year ago, and today I widen that tightrope of self-esteem to remember it's okay to feel good or great (or terrible), and that it's okay to remember my strengths. In doing that though, I don't lose that tightrope altogether, I remember there is a deep end to fall off of, I remember the existence and limits of my strengths, and **most of all**: *today I remind myself I am getting better*.

Today I'd like to encourage you to widen your tightropes and be comfortable in your self-esteem. To remind you wonderful people that it's okay to feel good or bad about yourselves and that no matter how broken you may feel, you are beautiful on the inside.

I limit myself and don't express myself like I do with family. Like I seem fake. 

She asked me why I did that, what's behind. After a while we arrived to the conclusion that I'm afraid others will leave me. Because I act like this (follow the other person etc) mostly when I think the other doesn't like \ want me. There was this girl for example, we met at university, went out for a while, I acted spountaneous with her, when I first met her. After a while I wasnt able to form a real bond, the friendship was superficial, because of my shyness and SA I think (it's always like this, in every relation I had). So I found she hanged out with me less, didn't text me etc, she made other friends in the class. And my anxiety towards her was really high, I wasnt able to look at her or to sit near her during lessons! Because I thought ""maybe she find me boring, shy, or I did something wrong, maybe that time I laughed a little more, or maybe I said something wrong!"". And at this point I detach myself completely, I isolate. 

So all of this is because I'm afraid the other will leave, and maybe by acting fake I think this won't happen, because I always agreed with others, I try to be gentle etc...I think ""if I act like others expect\want, they will like me"". 

One thing that my therapist said is: maybe the other person is simply busy with other things, or maybe you aren't the type of friend they want, but it can happen! Then she asked me :""do you think the other person started to speak and stay less with you, because you didn't show interest? And I remained silent because I didn't know. Maybe yes, I don't show interest in relationships because I'm afraid to get close and to have delusions!

Let me explain. I got discord a few months ago. I was super excited. I was shifting away from skype and people kept telling me how awesome discord was and that it was the 'new wave of socializing' I find that most of the time (and i am on quite often from the morning to night time.) That 80% of the users that are online are 'Idle' mode. The rest are offline. of that 80% most don't type anything. And even less amount very few at all use the voice chat.

The shock...or maybe not so much shock. i take that back... has been the negative attitude i get from people about the thought of going into voice chat. some are just super creeped out by it. They either don't wanna talk to strangers, hate their voice, don't have a mic etc. Some just feel like talking in general is bad.

I think most of the people use discord to play games and occasionally talk to someone if they have to. I understand discord is a 'gaming' social network. I just hope someday it crosses the gamers only frame of mind and is open to those that aren't as into hardcore gaming.

I found that most of those that use discord have extreme anxiety about the thought of communicating with others even just typing or even worse the thought of talking to someone else on discord.
Can i just ask why people get discord if they are too nervous/afraid to use it?

I find that most people that use discord are just lurkers. And the few that are active discords generally are those that are much younger than i. like.. 15 to 21 that tend to be vulgar and crass with their comments and jokes.

Here i thought discord was going to be the cool new 'skype' type program where you can talk to people and make fiends. where in actuality it's mostly people that just leave the program on and walk away or just 'lurk' and say nothing.

I'm not sure if it's cause i'm 'old school' grew up in the 80's 90's and see no problem with typing, talking to others in a chat room. But discord was i think made for socializing. I wish people used it for that. Even in discords that advertise as 'social' in the social genre really aren't social. I'm gonna give channels the benefit of the doubt and say maybe those that use discord are mostly in a different time zone than me. But even those that show they are 'online' They say nothing really.

I've tried going into some of these channels to start conversations with people using typing and some kinda become shocked that someones trying to communicate. I just seem to be in a lose/lose situation with these discord channels.

What am i doing wrong? Is this how discord socializing is supposed to be? Why does me wanting to talk to people make me feel like the odd 'bad person' like the annoying creep. When i just wanna make friends.",socialanxiety,t5_2r22n,I'm finding this to be the deal with most discords i joined. If you can recommend a discord to me that isn't like this let me know.

I had kept this somewhat managed by daily life things for many, many years. Yes, I have lived with depression since my tweens, and have been on and off pills, mostly because every pharmacological answer caused me to go more depressed, and at some point I didn't leave my bed for a few months during a summer. 

I have been abused emotionally and sexually by a former partner, someone who doesn't even deserve that word. I grew up with an abusive parent, and the other parent would leave us for months at a time and start new relationships with other people. Surprisingly, my parents are still married, but it's pretty a unhealthy relationship based in bickering. 

I have lived through rape as punishment, psychological abuse, abandonment, and cheating to the point where I would find this person with their ex spouse in my bed on a weekly basis. This person always made it clear that I would always be less important than their former partner and child. Always. 

Moving on, I met the person that would be my spouse, and they made it clear that they'd never cheat, and never leave. I let myself trust, and have lived with this person for many, many years. Until they cheated on me, and never once asked ""how can I regain your trust?"" 

I feel broken. I feel unworthy of the air that I breathe. I feel like dying, and fantasize about ways to do it while minimizing other people's involvement or even responsibility. How to write the letters, how to let them off the hook. 

I've been on a waiting list for individual therapy for a while, and I'm currently taking an SSRI that has been keeping things at bay, like a little egg-shell of a shield that is helping me get some room to deal with my own and then with the outside world.

I'm in the process of being diagnosed with PTSD as well.

This past August, I started therapy for real after years of asking for financial help from my family. My life kinda fell apart and they were worried. Had they helped sooner, we wouldn't have gotten there, but whatever, 20/20 hindsight. It was amazing, I got diagnosed, I got meds, I started  working out 5 times a week, I felt like the world was at my feet. Ileft Christianity (not publically) and finally embraced myself for who I was. I even asked a guy out (between being raised religiously and due to developmental delays, I had only dated one other guy before). He was cool, life was awesome.

December last year, I aggravated an old injury that had never fully healed and it put me in a walking boot. I lost my job (waitressing) because of it. No matter, I soldiered on. By the end of December, I felt a depressive episode creeping up, and did everything I could to try to stay stable. With BPD2, sometimes you can abort these things before they happen, or at least shorten them. It was rocky, but I was managing. Actually, I was amazing myself with my ability to hold on. Very proud of myself. 

Then January came. It's a long and complicated story, so I'll summarize. The guy raped me. It was my first time. It was anal sex without lube or a condom. He dumped me when it was over. The therapist's first words when I told her were ""Are you sure he just didn't realize you didn't want to? Sounds like you were showing pretty positive signs.""

I stopped seeing her. I've been scrambling to find new people, but the universe is lined up in just such a way that everyone I've found who *does* take my insurance is full up at the moment and has been for the past few months.

Since January the world gets darker and darker every damn day. The first 3 months after the rape were spent very much in shock and numbness. For a long time, I wouldn't even admit to myself that it was rape (thanks, therapist). I can't tell my family because I'm afraid (with grounds to be) that while they will think it's very sad, that it wasn't *really* rape (it's complicated) and that if I was practicing Christianity, it wouldn't have happened and that Christianity is the cure. 

The world wasn't done crumbling, either. The injury turned out to be severe and required surgery to fix. I was non-weight bearing for 6 weeks, non-driving for 8 weeks. I won't be able to go back to physical labor/performance (I'm an actor combatant) until October at the earliest. That in itself was a huge trial. And it was then that the depression got its final claws in. There wasn't any hope after that. 

It's been almost 7 months since the rape, 4 since surgery, and it still feels like it was all yesterday. The combination of EVERYTHING, ADHD/PTSD/BPD2 is killing me. 

I started smoking weed last December after my injury because I couldn't sleep (without the intense exercise, my body never got rid of enough energy to sleep). After I was able to drive after my surgery, I basically spent a month a half high as a kite. The crushing soul pain was lifted, and I felt like I could breathe. I could fall asleep again. But it always wears off, you know? And it's expensive at $20 a gram. I can smoke that in 2 days. Obviously, I was developing a high tolerance. I hated how spacey I was. Even if that spacey wasn't painful, I was still stagnant. So I stopped. 

Now, I *never* know if I'm going to fall asleep at night. I never know if I'm gonna have nightmares. I *do* know that regardless of when I fall asleep, I'm going to wake up somewhere between 4:45am and 7am. I don't ever sleep longer.

I keep looking back to those brief 3 months of awesomeness. They truly were amazing. I was full of hope, energy, and excitement for the future in a way I'd never felt before. It's all that much more cruel, you know?

I hate my job. I'm single because my ex was extremely non-communicative, and I suspect asexual...even though I don't doubt she cared about me, she was ridiculously emotionally inaccessible, and a terrible communicator.

I started dating someone I really liked for awhile, but she broke it off because her own depression got too much to handle a relationship...I completely respect her for doing it, but the weird thing is, I miss her more than my earlier, more long-term ex...maybe I'm just hung up on her because we broke it off before we had a chance to sleep together. I dunno.

I lost my dog this year, who I'd known since she was a puppy. I lost my last remaining grandparent. I lost a close college friend to suicide. I was gaslighted out of a line therapy job I was really good at and loved; I was bumped to starting pay, had benefits stripped, had my hours cut, and all my favorite clients were taken away...all to cover the asses of my dipshit privileged bosses. Earlier this year I had a stomach ulcer. My daily depression and anxiety attacks have been getting worse and worse. The last 3 mental health professionals I saw didn't help...one referred me to a psychiatrist, who recommended a ton of really scary, invasive drugs without trying milder ones first - the third I saw yesterday, who referred me to yet more people who will no doubt waste my time and money further. I've been building a legal case against my crooked ex-landlady but I can't afford a lawyer so at this point, she's probably going to get away with all her fuckery. I filed an official complaint with the Department of Consumer Protection, but they're slow as hell, and refuse to offer legal advice. I hooked up with someone who turned out to have mega unhealthy attachment issues...when I broke things off with her, she bombarded me with abusive texts for a day and a half, then told me she loved me, then continued sending abusive texts until I stopped responding to her completely. 

All this has been my life for the past 10 months. I lean really hard on my friends by venting to help me get through the day, but I can tell it's getting hard on them. 

I don't know what kind of work I want to do next. All the fun jobs don't pay enough, all the ones that do pay as much as I'm making now ($12/hour - no benefits) are just as soul-crushing as my current job. All the jobs I apply to with a decent balance of both compensation and work I actually think might be fun are either taken before I can apply, or I'm outright rejected because I'm still young and don't have any fucking experience yet. I'm drowning in debt. I'm flailing. My parents are both abusive idiots who never make me feel anything but worse after I talk to them. I keep sinking lower but I don't know what to do.

I'm 25. My life is 1/3rd over and I've spent most of it getting abused and feeling miserable over and over again...everyone I ask for help either tells me they can't, takes advantage of me, or tries to help but fails spectacularly. Every time I try to help myself, by working up the gumption to apply for a job I'm actually interested in, my efforts blow up in my face and push me deeper into the spiral.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what the fuck I should do. I don't know if I even believe the 'it gets better' shit because for the past 13 years, my life has only gotten marginally better. I worked my ass off in college so this exact situation wouldn't happen. I pushed thoughts of suicide out of my head when I was a teenager because I dismissed everything as ""just par for the course of dealing with high school""; I bargained with myself that I wouldn't think about things like this again until after high school, when things were supposed to 'get better'...but they haven't. Not really.

This has been one of the worst years of my life. On par with my Middle School years, which says a fucking lot. I don't believe the universe is going to pull off some kind of balancing act just for me - just because I've been through hell this year doesn't mean something at the end of the tunnel is waiting for me. I've learned that much about life.

I just...I just want to be done with all of this. I don't want depression. I don't want anxiety. I don't want post-traumatic stress. But nobody can or will help me. Even myself.

 what are peoples' opinions on showing self harm scars? I would be comfortable to show my arms, despite how badly scarred they are, but I'm so worried about triggering somebody else. 

  If I see other people have scars, I feel a strange sense of kinship towards them. I'd never say anything, but I feel protective and sort of safe as well, around them. But I can't imagine how I'd feel if my arms made someone want to hurt themself, or my still-underweight  body made someone want to skip lunch that day or run and run until their feet bleed. 

 How can I exist, with my body as it is, without triggering other people? My body is scarred and skinny still. It's obvious that I'm mentally ill, or I have been. How do you guys deal with this? How would you feel, whether you self harm or not, about seeing the evidence of someone's illness on their skin?

Thanks to my many disabilities and my own selfishness I've fucked up a lot and felt I was destroying our precious family. I'm better in that aspect now but still feel empty. I feel I can't do anything on my own without any of them. I'm growing up and my siblings have already found the loves of their lives and I..I have trouble talking and being with women thanks to being sexually abused by my step-sister when I was younger. That and I tend to ruin any relationship I've ever had. So I try and escape into my art. But I can't help but doubt myself thanks to growing up in an abusive cult. So all I have is my parents. And I'm not complaining I love them more than anything they're literally the best. But maybe I love them too much. I often have nightmares of one or either of them dying. I can't handle it. I would rather not live my life which I've already fucked up by scaring away most that wanted to be my friend. They are the only real reason I am still alive and continue living. I love my siblings but they seem to have already moved on. My sister has moved away and is married with a kid. My brother stopped being my friend after my suicide incident and barely ever comes homes let alone talk to me. All I have is my folks. It feels like most if not all my dreams have and will end up to shit. So when the time comes and they're gone then i'm gone. My mom is sick atm and my dad always travels for work. I can't help but worry for their safety. I have nothing else.  ",depression,t5_2qqqf,I've decided that when my parents pass away that'll be the end of my life as well.

I had a good group of friends, a huge passion for gaming plus I was doing well at school.

But as I grew older, school became an  burden; the pressure was mounting as exams - important to my future - were creeping up. 

To the average student, they couldn't care less about their performance. I on the other hand was dead serious about education; it was a all or nothing scenario. And my God, did I give it my all. In the final weeks I was putting in 80 hour weeks on top of school days to satisfy my perfectionist streak. 

In the months leading up to the exams I was feeling stressed. In the weeks leading up to the exams I was depressed and in the days leading up to the exams I was downright suicidal. 

After the storm has passed however, my depression has died down considerably (though not completely) and I have a good grasp on why I think that is. 

My case of depression stems from what is primarily a disconnect between ambitions. My initial ambition was to further my love of gaming; the other ambition to become a filthy-rich lawyer, banker or doctor.

Both these aspirations are very disparate in nature and to fulfil one aspiration I felt I had to ditch another. Ditching gaming in favour of all-out workaholic mode was a big mistake. It meant I lost part of my identity and childhood and made me question my enormous workload I'd put my self under at great cost to my happiness. 

Over the summer I rediscovered my passion for gaming, yet had to accept that my passion could never be the same again. I had to re-contextualise gaming within my ambition to reach a professional career. I couldn't spend 12 hour grinding sessions like I used to. Instead I integrated it as a reward for work. That way I could enjoy gaming without feeling guilty about studying. 

The point of all this long-winded rambling is nostalgia is powerful way to remedy - if only partially - mental illnesses like depression. Your job may be unsatisfying because it doesn't sit well with when made you tick in your earlier years. In which case, quit your job!

Of course this isn't practical for all, which is why I for example have a 'carrot on a stick' like approach where work is rewarded with nostalgia. 

Anyway, share your thoughts on my rambling speculation below.

I had a horrid day today. Seriously, it was beyond anything else as far as horrid days go. But it was headed to a trainwreck, i knew itd been building up towards it for a week

I was cutting my skin pretty much non stop during this time. Usually I calm down after feeling the muted pain on a vast bit of scarred skin (from skin grafts) but there's no room left there for cuts, nor on another scar I cut a lit less because it's in a place with a higher risk of exposure.

I don't do this normally, but I cut good skin in a safe place. It actually bled, which the scarred areas don't do, so that was good. It calmed me, I really helped me. But then my Internet stopped working. I'm a ducking nutcase that I need everything to be in order for me to be alright.

So I was using my shirty phone data to check my email when I realised my uni sent me a billion overnight. So I was fighting with my shirty phone net to solve multiple crises when I realised that there was no solving this. There just wasn't. And 60% of it was caused by my anxiety. I started banging my head on the wall because I didn't know what else to do.

But it wasn't helping, so I being a ducking genius grabbed my scarf and tied it around my neck, hooking it on my bedpost. I wasn't thinking. I just wanted everything to be gone, even if for a second. I was using my hand as a lever or something, I clearly hadn't thought this through and now I can't remember. Then I sat down on my bed and let my head fall. I thought I would raise it again, and that I wasn't actually serious about this, but it never happened.

I can't explain what happened next. I think I passed out because my side table was knocked away and my elbow hurt. I don't remember being on the floor or on the bed or standing. One seconditions my teeth felt funny, heavy or soemthing. The next I was glitching, there's no other way to explain it. My vision was lined and dotted and black and white and my thoughts were a nonsensical jumble of random things (which my troubles managed to seep into, that much I remember). I think I was seizing, I'm not sure. I remember trying to control some weird and intense quivers, whether they were in my head or in real life, and my thoughts.

It was great.

But then the realisation hit me. I was worried i gave myself brain damage, or something else (but thats unlikely because I checked everything and I'm alright on the surface, save for some bruises) I panicked. I panicked like I've never panicked before. I don't know much about this stuff, but I checked my arms and legs and neck to see if I'd damaged anything obvious

I've been fighting with my mum a lot, so I couldn't call her. I called my father, and apparently I wasn't making much sense because he kept asking me what's going on and then he rushed home from work to check on me.

I couldn't say I tried to kill myself, and maybe I was close to succeeding? I don't know. Lol. *seizure*, I told him. But then I did my best to pass it off as a panic attack so he doesn't make me take the year out from university, which he would do if he thought this to be some medical problem.

A couple of hours later he had food brought up and he watched me eat it to make sure I finish it. 

Well he called my mother anyway, and she came and dragged me to the doc who gave me very very light medication for anxiety. I think it's working because I'm calm enough to type, otherwise my vision was blurry and my fingers were shaking.

But it's great now, I have a puffy and bruised face and possible brain damage to worry about on top of everything else. Also I have people watching my food intake and monitoring my medication which is lovely too

Tl Dr : shit day with week-long buildup, severe anxiety problem, not an inch of skin left where I could cut myself, decided to choke myself with a scarf like a fuckwit and ended up having some kind of attack then passed off the resulting mess as a panic attack

And just for reference, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety but not depression. Idk if I'm moving towards that too, though.

Now the hospitalization only lasted three days because I was DESPERATE to get out due to how shitty it was. Anyways it's eight months later, and I'm on the road to recovery but I still don't feel ready. Like the pile of bullshit doesn't feel hopeless anymore. It's still gargantuan, and it's exhausting, but I'm scooping at it. 

I still have thoughts of dying, but not as strong. I still see being furiously happy as utter bullshit. I'm still half glassing it. I'm still ALWAYS tired, and always exhausted, but I'm also still fighting. 

I'm eating healthier (most of the time, I still don't eat some days). I see a therapist 3 times a week, I have a psychiatrist who spends more than 5 minutes with (20 to 30 actually!) I walk instead 30 minutes a day I drink at least two liters of water. The hardest thing is: I'm not letting myself sleep. I don't go home, I get up and out just to stay away, and my bed is a couch. 

Which comes to source of my guilt, of my trepidation, of anxiety. The one source that makes me want to break down in cry while being furiously angry: My siblings. They are pressuring and pressuring and pressuring me to get a job and work. The idea is scary, exhausting, and I know I'll have to jump at it eventually but I have until November (their cut off of support, because you know. If i'm not better by than I'm just a lazy good for nothing bum. Hey maybe I am.)  Right now, when food is a struggle, when sleep is my most desired thing, when I have to will myself to do something (after years of developing this coping tool of making things smaller I mind you) think about work, committing more than an hour to anything seems exhausting. Seems like it'll be enough stress to break me.

I've been resilient, but I still feel fragile. Like I'm one of those prince Rupert's drops that I'm so strong in nigh unbreakable in one spot, but flick me in another and I explode into hundreds of thousands of piece. So what are your thoughts.

I was unsuccessful. Every answer I found would slip away into doubt.

Today, I forced myself (at first) to read because I feel like I would be relieved because I was basically having a panic attack all day about not doing anything for weeks, well if I didn't use school as an excuse it would have been close to a year. Around 2 I opened my book and made myself a goal to read for 30 minutes. At first I wasn't interested but as the 30 minutes were over I wanted to finish the chapter (about 2 pages only). 

After I read I started cleaning my room because I was so stressed out about it. At first I really wasn't feeling like it, but as I forced myself to continue I just kept cleaning. 2 hours, and 3 trash bags later I have cleaned 90% of my room. Feels good. I also opened a window and opened the curtains and I feel renewed. I haven't felt this positive in a while. I feel like I am less lazy and more willing to do stuff like I was before I experienced depression. And to be honest my anxiety feels much better. I feel like I actually have a reason because I cleaned my room and read. I know that sounds silly but holy sh*t I was bored for too many months.

The evenings in summer are so nice a comforting.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"So, I cleaned my room and read some of my book today! Maybe you can benefit from this post."

It seems like distress tolerance and emotion regulation etc. are good skills to teach people, especially in a short term hospital setting where the exposure to material time is short. I see the ""bang for your buck"" value.

It wasn't violent, wasn't that bad on the scale of things, but because I was so young and it was every day it really impacted me. 

I'm in therapy, and it was helpful at first but now I dread appointments. My therapist changed over the summer as my first one is only contracted with the school for 9 months a year. The new one is very focused on making me write out accounts of the trauma, and doing worksheets. I tell her that I don't think the worksheets help very much, and she'll go ""hmm"" and assign me different worksheets. 

I have a hard time opening up in therapy. I don't like non-mutal vulnerability, so I put up walls and can't get emotional around her. I don't do this on purpose, I try not to, but I just feel sort of numb when talking to her. She commented that I didn't cry when talking about my abuse, which made me feel bad. I feel very detached from myself oftentimes, I have a general idea what emotion I'm feeling but don't feel it very strongly.

I don't want to be this way anymore. I can be a really cheerful, social person sometimes- I wish I could be like that all the time. It's so frustrating because I'm really determined to get over this but I don't know what to do because I'm not making any progress in therapy even after I've explained the situation to her.

Someone to talk to, or help me vent, something.  I moved to this new city, where I know nobody.  My wife and I both came here.  I was already depressed.

She was literally my world.  Even now, five months after we split, I'm desperately in love with her and don't know what to do.  But I hate her.  Kind of.  She had an affair.  Emotional for sure, possibly physical.  Especially with how it played out, I believe it was physical.  I've had a fairly rough life, with an abusive step-father, drug-addled mother, and growing up on my own as a lower class family on welfare.  I'm doing alright for myself, but I know nobody. 

I've always been a loner, because I grew up with one friend.  I confided everything in him, and he was all the support I needed.  Just the one person.  When I met my wife, I joined the military and we moved away.  She became everything to me.  I didn't need other friends (serious ones, I had work friends and the casual hang out friend), so when we moved away to this new town I once again knew nobody.

However, once we got here, we started growing distant.  She met this guy, started hanging out with him, and that was it.  She started going on dates, even spent my fucking birthday on a date with him, showing up past 5pm with gifts I specifically said I hadn't wanted (Fallout 4, had no interest in game) and having bailed on the one thing I wanted, that we always did (going out to dinner together; she ate with him).  

A bunch of other shit happened, I finally broke up with her.  I was scared, desperate, and lonely.  I took too long breaking up with her, and she just hurt me more and more.  I finally had to plan my own break up, because every time I tried previously, she'd sweet talk me back into staying.  How it would work out, etc.  So I actually plan my own break up.   Wasn't that a fun fucking weekend.

Now, it's months later, and I feel like I'm falling apart.  I've spent essentially four months completely alone.  I don't know anybody here.  I'm not on speaking terms with any of my family.  I cut ties with that original friend years ago because he took a bad path in life and was a terrible influence.  I just *don't know what to do*, and I'm scared because I feel like everything is falling apart.  And it hurts.  and I'm *scared*, because I can't control myself, or my thoughts, or anything.

I have a really really bad sinus infection which apparently is bad enough to be affecting my balance and blood pressure and has been giving me headaches. My mom died when just before I started my senior year of high school we were estranged because I moved out because she was a really bad alcoholic and I couldn’t take it anymore and was running out of money to feed myself and my siblings over there. I blame myself for her death because she died less than a year after and she was bipolar and I think she may have killed herself. No one will tell me how she died and she was 49 and found alone. She was the only one who I ever felt love from until she became an alcoholic and then I had to take care of her and my siblings. I was feeling suicidal and ordered her death certificate and it’s here now and I’m scared to open it because I’m afraid I ordered it to tip me over the edge. I’m waiting to talk to my therapist about it. I currently commute to college and live with my emotionally abusive and neglectful dad and his fiancé. They are both pretty narcissistic and may have undiagnosed NPD. I get in trouble for having depression which is completely ignored and for me to figure out on my own.

I feel completely abandoned by everyone who was supposed to love or take care of me and I'm scared to do anything positive for myself because I think people I care about will die if I do.



I’m broken inside and have so many wounds from my childhood and more I discover as I go on that I don’t think I’ll ever be healed and come back from it. I also have a lot of self hate because I don’t think I’m good enough to deserve love or kindness because that’s how I was raised. Emotions were bad and so was having any wants or needs and my parents needs were supposed to come first and I was never supposed to upset them and it’s ingrained in me and theres so much emotional pain that I deal with and it makes me want to die so that I can escape it. But I tried that once a couple years ago with a car in a garage and I stopped it after 7 minutes in their and don’t think I could do it again so I’m stuck feeling this way with no real escape.



I can’t even sleep well because my dad sometimes comes and starts yelling at me while I’m sleeping so I never feel safe or relaxed and have a lot of nightmares and it’s hard to sleep when you associate it with coming under attack.

So far after googling I only get sites where I'm answering questions for 20 minutes then just to be told I have to pay to get my results. Great way to treat a person in such a need of help right? I used to go to therapists but the atmosphere alone was unbareable. Sitting in a tiny room with bright lights and face to face with the therapist. Very uncomfortable. Any help is greatly appreciated thank you. ,mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Recent severe mental health decline

To make things short, she passed away September 2, 2015. And needless to say, I fell into a depression as she was close to me. The fall out of this is that my health and grades suffered.

However when reflecting on things, while I did not have the energy to do personal tasks, when something comes up where I can help another person, especially a person that I care deeply, I feel the once impossible tasks due to being so tired are now possible with this surge of energy.

For example,  I have an older brother who needed a physical desktop to do a web cam interview and the only available room with one was my room; but the problem is that my room back then was messy. Despite this, I managed to clean the room within a day time. This was incredible as there was ~100 pounds of things dispersed in the room and me being a petite young adult male. Yet, I did it.

I loved this girl very much, she seemed close to perfection to me and I planned so much stuff we would do together. But I did mess up here and there, and I suppose it became a big part of why she break up with me. She did so after 2 weeks of being away, telling me she feels uncomfortable in a relationship, that she wants to be free and have time for herself  and hearing something like that after being excited for her return was a huge hit. She suddenly become cold and distant and just…thinking about it now, she had valid reasons all in all and I knew I messed up a lot, but at that time I felt incredibly broken. She left me with a void that I waited day by day to be filled.

This year something similiar happened. But this girl seemed different – after talking and talking together, I thought I found someone special, that we had a special bond and that she could be the one for a good, stable relationship. Time went by, and she was supposed to leave for 2 weeks. I was scared considering what happened last year. The circumstances were just way too similiar, but she was a different girl and she knew about this fear and told me not to worry, so I decided to trust her. In the end…my fear became reality, even worse than  expected…she cheated on me and then broke up with me, giving me the same reasons as the girl from last year, although her definition of free was be able to do…certain stuff with other guys.

A lot of people around me just tell she is not worth anything, but I still feel very broken, as I trusted her and she knew how precious trust can be, and yet she decided to do this. I miss her, I am angry at her, I am dissappointed by her…but most of all I am losing confidence and motivation to go on. I doubt myself, not being good enough to keep her faithful, thinking when I messed up like once or twice was enough to just doom it all. I wonder if I am cursed and every girl I fall in love with will be like that. I feel so hopeless when my friends tell me I did my best to be a great boyfriend and thats its not my fault, and knowing I still ended up being the one who suffers. I feel so betrayed and like used like a napkin knowing all we experienced together was just a lie and she managed to wipe it away just like that all in exchange for time-to-time fun with dudes. And lastly as fool...not taking enough time to get to know her, allowing myself to trust her and being deceived by her lies.

I know I have good friends, a good family and a comfortable life…but a girlfriend just always was something that made me complete and was a big part of my happiness and confidence.

All 4 psychiatrists disagree, with each other, about which meds are best for my bipolar2 and ADHD.  Specific examples below.  I can’t tell a good psych from a bad one.  My personal experience showed doctor review websites, like healthgrades, are worthless.  Lastly, does my new psych sound skillful?



**INTRO**



I’ve now seen 4 psychiatrists, since my bipolar2 diagnosis 3 years ago (diagnosed ADHD as kid).  I just saw the 4th one (psych4), for the first time.  She was very self-confident, and blunt, which I like.  But, she also strongly disagreed with my 3 previous psychs, about which meds I should take.



I have to return to work in 20 days.  I need to have a good psych by then.  I don’t know if I should stay with my new psych, or keep looking.  It’s like I’m walking, blindly, in a chaotic storm … and if I go in the wrong direction, I get fucked.



**CONTRADICTION 1 - ADHD MEDS**



Psych1 – Take stimulants, but only when you need to.



Psych2 – hospital psych - Doesn’t believe anyone with bipolar should take stimulants.



Psych3 – Doesn’t believe in stimulants, at all.  Said exercise and healthy nutrition are enough.  I’m pretty damn certain that statement is false.



Psych4 – Take stimulants daily, even when not working.  It will make your life better, and doesn’t accelerate tolerance buildup.



**CONTRADICTION 2 – ANTIDEPRESSANTS (AD’s)**



Psych1 – When depressed, it’s okay to take SSRI’s and Wellbutrin XL.



Psych2 – hospital psych - Never take any AD’s.



Psych3 – Never take any AD’s.



Psych4 – Don’t take SSRI’s.  Take Wellbutrin XL.  Even large doses are typically fine for type2’s.



**CONTRADICTION 3 – ANTIPSYCHOTICS**



Psych1 – Latuda worked for depression, but she wouldn’t prescribe much propranolol, to fight the akathisia, so psych had me stop.  I tried a few other antipsychotics – none worked.  So, psych had me keep taking SSRI for depression.



Psych2 – hospital psych – My 1st visit he said take Seroquel … that it works for depression and mania.  But, since psych1 pretty much fucked me over, and landed me in the hospital … I trusted no one.  I refused all meds, until I could leave hospital, and get a 2nd opinion.



Psych3 – Got out of hospital, and saw him.  I mentioned taking Latuda in the past, for depression.  He said Latuda only worked for depression, not mania.  He said Seroquel treated depression and mania.  I was still unstable, so I went back to the hospital, so they could quickly dose me up on Seroquel, and stabilize me.



Psych2 – hospital psych – He welcomed me back to the hospital.  I mentioned what psych3 said about Latuda vs Seroquel, and so I was willing to take Seroquel.  He said Latuda treats depression and mania - that psych3 was wrong.  Since Latuda worked for my depression, before, he put me on 80mg Latuda, with plenty of Propranolol and Klonopin, for the akathisia.



Psych3 – Saw him after getting out of hospital.  I told him psych2 put me on Latuda, instead.  All he said was Latuda will work just fine – I was sitting there thinking WTF!?  Anyways, I kept taking Latuda.  But, this psych did have me stop taking Klonopin, and, instead, had me take higher doses of Propranolol.  Eventually, though, the akathisia was too strong, so I had to quit 2 weeks later.  I stopped seeing psych3, after I quit, so I never started a new antipsychotic.



**NOTE** I’m not sure if I would have been able to keep taking Latuda, even if I kept taking propranolol **and Klonopin**, like psych2 prescribed, in the hospital.  But, psych3 said I can’t take Klonopin for more than a couple weeks, since it’s a benzo.  I searched online, and found people that said the same thing.  Therefore, I decided to believe psych3, and never tried taking Latuda, **with Klonopin**, again.



Psych4 – I forgot to ask her what she thought about taking Klonopin with Latuda.  Anyways, she said I didn’t need to take any antipsychotic, since I’m mostly back to normal, and actually might be entering a depressive episode. She put me on Wellbutrin XL, for now.",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,"4 psychs disagree on my meds. God, help me find an answer."

First of all sorry about the tacky introduction, that is horrendous. I am a 20 year old girl (and Dachshund companion) currently fighting my own uphill battle, and while it may not be as difficult as some others, I would love to have the opportunity to get it off my chest.
I'm someone who has always used games as an outlet. As a kid I was the weird one out with one eye blind, and my social standing was pretty much destroyed. And at home my parents consisted of arguments, substance abuse, and a cocktail of resentment for themselves.

 So I turned to my computer, starting with social games, to the sims, to anything I could get my hands on and to this day I find games both my greatest comfort and my greatest vice.

In recent years I still am very unsociable besides behind a screen, the confidence of being away and out of the line of fire help so much and what has happened to me recently didn't help my understanding in anyway.


I was already having a rough year, constantly missing bill deadlines, not eating for days at a time and worst of all hiding it from people out of embarrassment. The worst thing was knowing I didn't really have anybody I felt I could fall back on. So I continued on scared and scraping it together while fighting my own inner demons of self-worthlessness.

One night I was particularly hungry, I ordered from a late night food delivery establishment that had cheap food usually ordered by university students and the guy delivering it seemed pushy but nice!

He called before getting here which I thought normal, however what wasn't normal is he seemed to already know that I was into games, and started asking me questions about them. Figuring somehow I maybe let something slip I obliged in trying to atleast have common ground with the gentleman. After a few minutes I made up some excuse to get off the phone and awaited my food, what could go wrong I thought to myself.


When he arrived I looked down to get the cash and he forced his way in. I am 5ft and he was quite a lot bigger before I knew anything I was dragged up my own stairs into my own bed screaming until I was in a state of silent shock.
The fact that my own home, and self were taken from me shock me still. And it was something that I bawled about and howled and screamed, and then suddenly like a disconnected plug it seemed so surreal.


I am fortunate I am still alive, that I am ok, and that I'm physically alright. After the incident cops were called and he later made threats against my life a second time, and I had to stay at a hotel for my own safety.


I have to put on this brave face and I don't know that I can do it anymore. Everyday is like a rollercoaster between disassociated content to disgust and anger to screaming and crying when I look at my bed. And to make matters worse I don't even have the funds to change my bedsheets and blankets so every night it a reminder of it all.

For someone who was already a self-loathing individual going through a hardship this is just too much for me. This type of abuse is the most common strain in my life, and I have been sexually exploited even as a child. I have had moments where I have threatened my life, I had a suicide attempt last year well before this happened which resulted in a 72 hour hospital hold and a traumatizing experience. I'm scared that my fear of the hospital will subside and I will really just go for it. 

I'm scared of people, and myself, and everything around me all the time. I'm scared of my loved ones who don't understand and try to brush it off as an emotion I can switch or that ""I shouldn't say those things""

I'm 18 years old, and I'm a quite social person, honestly. I don't want to sit in my basement, I wanna be out with my friends, but no matter where I am, or who I'm with, nothing helps. I still feel empty inside, well, it's actually become what's pretty close to a constant feeling of morosity. I'm overly empathic, but at the same time apathic. I do believe I may be bipolar, like my grandfather was, but it's strange, because I've been depressed since I was 12-13, but even before that I was never really happy.

It's strange, however, because the manic periods only seem to last for a few days or two, where I, despite my rational nature, end up doing dumber and dumber things, until I at last crash and end up severely depressed again. I'm almost suicidal in my behaviour, or at the very least severely selfdestructive in the non-depressed periods, even more so than I am whilst depressed. I have trouble sleeping, I may have anxiety, ADD, developing schizophrenia and some sort of anti-social personality disorder. I do for sure have OCD, which greatly increases in my most anxious/bad periods. I've tried which has had even a slight possibility of working, but nothing has ever really helped. Only made it worse.

That was, until  I tried mushrooms this February - It worked wonders and completely cured the depression for 2-3 months, and then I took some more, and it held it at bay until around June. It's gotten worse since then, though. Nothing helps. Not shrooms, not partying, not meditation, not anti-depressants(I actually feel worse on those), not weed(it sure did, though. Still does for a couple of hours.), not speaking with a psychologist, a therapist, a doctor, my friends.... I've cried twice in the past many years, since I became a teenager, I guess. When I was told my grandfather had died, and at his funeral. Him dying in december really fucked me up for a while, until the shrooms that I've already mentioned. Oh, and now. I'm sobbing and shaking now, not for any particular reason, I just think I'm afraid. I can feel it getting worse and worse by the minute, and I sure do already feel terribly awful. It's like a heavy truck on the highway, just gathering momentum, and with nothing to stop it. 
I've never really been suicidal, because things are gonna get better, right? But I sure wouldn't mind if something happened to my existence. It's gonna be a long life, if my future is anything like my past.

So my parents borrowed my car a couple times in the last couple days because they needed to drop my mum's car off somewhere/pick it back up, etc. When I turned on my car this morning to go to work, the wipers were left on, the air was turned on full blast, the radio was on loud. 
And I had almost no gas. I mean, maybe its minor annoyances but it still pissed me off, because if I had done that with their car, they would have gotten pissed w/me. 

So when I got home from work (about an hour ago), I said to my mom that I was a little annoyed they hadn't bothered to leave my car the way it was when they borrowed it. And she got super angry at me for bringing it up or something? I'm still not sure what happened, but basically she was mad at me for being mad. 

I did say that it was frustrating that they didn't think about ME when they did that, and she was all ""well that's right, I never think about anyone else ever, I only think about myself"" in that super sarcastic angry way. Which just made me angrier, because she was completely ignoring my point, and trying to make ME feel guilty for being angry. 

She left to go drop my sister off somewhere but like? I don't even know what to say right now. Isn't it reasonable to expect some courtesy when you're borrowing someone else's shit? I'm sick of not saying anything when I get disrespected or ignored in this house, but this is what happens when I do.

I've been working on stuff with this day program group therapy thing that I'm paying through the nose for, but I feel like my family doesn't give a shit and they really would rather I just kill myself so I'm out of their way. 

I'm this close to just asking them if they want me to kill myself, but I wouldn't get an honest answer.

I think I’m actually losing my mind, and my grasp on reality. Thoughts of killing myself and wanting to die are constant.

I don’t always want to kill myself, I just want this to stop so badly. I don’t want someone I know to find my body. I don’t want to try only to fuck it up and wake up exposed and feeling like shit. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just can’t live like this anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel terrible all the time. I don’t know if I’m crazy and it’s all psychological, or if it’s actual symptoms of a medical condition. I can’t tell the difference anymore. Maybe I just want someone to give me a name for what the hell is wrong with me. There is still a part of me that doesn’t believe depression and anxiety are really real, that this is just how I am, and it’s all my fault.

&amp;nbsp;

The only respite I have is weed. But it isn’t enough to calmly waste my life away feeling high and somewhat okay, knowing that the moment I come down I’ll be in hell. I can’t do it anymore. I am so, so tired. I don’t know what else to do other than end it.

I can feel my boyfriend pulling away. I’ve tried so hard to keep our relationship stable in the midst of all this, but I honestly can’t blame him for not wanting me anymore. I’m nothing. I’m a fragile, sad, worthless, lazy stoner who will never be able to hold any sort of relationship together. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t know how to pull myself out of this. I don’t know what to do. I need answers, and no one has them. Everything I do to help myself just feels like stalling the inevitable. I’m going to die. I want to die. I feel so close to it. I feel like a total lost cause. What little time I can manage to stay alive will be nothing but agony.

&amp;nbsp;

I need help, but I don’t think there is anything on this earth that can help me. I’ve tried all the “right” things.

I know a number of the psych/crisis staff and I think someone managed to get in touch with the psychiatrist who knows me well and knows my BPD diagnosis and bullshit I get myself into.

I didn't get tackled or anything. Just pulled and 'herded' in the right direction. Kind of fun except then I was labeled a ""flight risk"".

Because let me tell you, you can't move out of your mom's house and pay your medical bills without money.  Or pay for more schooling, or therapy, or anything.

What am I supposed to do?  I keep getting told to go study something I enjoy, but I don't enjoy anything.  Meanwhile, my choices are even more limited because of an inability to socialize.  Goddamn anxiety and brain and such.  Can't even do the same horrific jobs that other people my age have already passed through, like retail cashier.

And then everyone expects me to know what I'm supposed to do and make decisions.  Like how do I decide what job I can do?  Or how I'd pay for the next semester of school to study something I'm certain won't be fulfilling at all?  You need 6 credit hours to saddle yourself with a loan, but that means I have to somehow pick an extra, useless class, which is even less appealing to me, let alone difficult to figure out.  And I've got no money for anything as is, and I don't think I'll ever be able to work, let alone have a job that doesn't make me want to shoot myself.

I try to tell my mom that every goddamn thing is wrong in my life, but she doesn't get it and starts yelling.  Everything is wrong!  I don't have the words to explain that, which loops back to the first problem.

At least if I could have someone to hold onto, there'd be that, but everything's wrong and shitty about my life that that's not realistic either.  So what is?  My birthday is coming up and I wouldn't even know how far out if today's date wasn't plastered on the bottom of this screen.  I don't want to remember.  I don't want to think of how old I've gotten and have just lived one of the worst years of my life despite MY WHOLE LIFE being absolute shit.  It's painful to think of how much time I've wasted, and for what?  I've got nothing at all.  And nothing's ever going to be enough.  Not for me.  I'm not the kind of person where things are normal or working out in any significant way.  I can't even explain this to my therapist.  I don't need to hear that same old promise every year or get told that I don't know it's not going to get better.  I know nothing is worth this, and I know how life works for me.  It doesn't.

I knew this day would come but I have not been prepared for it. I thought I found the jackpot but in the back of my mind I knew, that anything that seems too good to be true, is true.

My fiancee she really loves me, and I love her. We have our differences but with everything in our lives we are the most positive influence on each other.

She has told me she is okay with it. But as our friends grow and have children, it is harder and harder on her. I let her speak her mind without judging her or getting mad, and she felt much better. She admitted that she has trouble coping with the prospect of a future with no children of our own.

Why do I not want children? I have a demon inside of me. My parents have demons inside of them. We aren't all bad but the demons make us do and say and think awful things. I could never bring a child into this world. How terrible would that be? They would be damned to be as evil as I am. As crazy as I am, maybe worse. Besides this world is nothing but suffering. I do not want to live; never have; life is terrible. Awful. Its the worst thing you could do to someone is make them alive! Her and I don't agree and I love her optimism and love for the innocent people in this world. But innocent or not my child would have demons inside him like I do. I could not stand to watch him or her live in hell like I do.

So, if mania flares up, again, within a year ... no FMLA job protection - I'll be fired.

(Q) Can I continue to use FMLA for leave due to my chronic serious health condition?

**ANSWER**

...employees continue to be able to use FMLA leave for any period of incapacity or treatment due to a chronic serious health condition...

To qualify as having a ""chronic serious health condition,"" you must meet 3 conditions:

**1** requires “periodic visits” (2+ per year) for treatment by a health care provider

**2** continues over an extended period of time

**3** may cause episodic rather than continuing periods of incapacity

**MY QUESTIONS**

**1** Do these statements mean bipolar disorder qualifies as a ""chronic serious health condition?""

**2** If yes, how many weeks of FMLA coverage do I get?

**3** What docs are required, as evidence, for HR to change my FMLA coverage?

Last night I went to a hypnosis show thing at my college. The guy doing it said how people feel good when they're hypnotized. Even though I didnt volunteer I still followed the instructions. I went through what I'd say was about the first level of him trying to hypnotize the volunteers before breaking my concentration and stopping. I didnt think I'd feel much different but at least for that first level of hypnosis I'd say I was feeling pretty good. I guess that comes from the fact that you're supposed to focus on very small details and nothing else unless told to. So I wasnt thinking about anything I would usually be worried about. But even after my concentration was broken I still felt better than before. I laughed a lot at all the things the volunteers did. I hadnt felt that good in awhile. Before someone says ""its all in your head"" obviously it is. It was in my head but if I just tell myself ""feel good"" it doesnt work. I've tried meditating before and it didnt work either but if it is possible I might try this again because it did work if only a little bit.

I stop to tie my shoelaces,

And my friends say they’ll wait for me round the corner.

Logic says there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be there,

But all I see ahead of me is an empty street.

&amp;nbsp;

I have so much to say,

And yet I say so little -

I’m always screaming

Without making a sound.

Words and emotions fill my mind,

An endless whirlpool in my head,

But all that emerges from my mouth is,

‘I’m fine, just tired’.

&amp;nbsp;

Time ticks away,

Unnoticed, but ever present.

For others, a motivation towards achievement,

For me, a reminder of how little I’m accomplishing.

Of course it moves at a constant rate,

Although for me it seems to make an exception -

Weeks of monotony pass in the blink of an eye,

But a single day of sadness can last an eternity.

&amp;nbsp;

I do no work,

But I am mentally tired.

I do no exercise,

But I am physically tired.

I could fall asleep at any point in the day,

My head void of thoughts

But as soon as I get into bed,

Fears and worries plague my mind, and rest eludes me.

&amp;nbsp;

I would hate to speak a malicious word to anyone,

And yet I tie myself up in a web of insults,

I would not touch a fly,

And yet I harm my own body.

Sticks and stones may break my bones,

But it is my thoughts that chip at my will to carry on.

Indeed, the scars on my arm sting only a little, physically,

But in my mind they burn me with the fury of a thousand stars.

&amp;nbsp;

And so apparently while I should be filled with life,

It all seems to be draining from me instead.

All that remains is an empty vessel,

Whose captain contemplates jumping ship.

Is Death really the stranger that we spend our lives running from?

Or more of a long-lost friend, looking for a chat.

And while it is with shackles that he beckons me,

I see only freedom in his imprisonment.

&amp;nbsp;

What is the solution

To this unanswerable question?

Where does the finish line lie

In a seemingly never-ending marathon?

I look into the mirror to see someone I do not recognise,

I look into my mind to see a vast expanse of uncharted territory.

I am, by definition, me,

&amp;nbsp;

And yet I am not myself.",depression,t5_2qqqf,A Tale of Contradictions

So I am diagnosed Bipolar II, GAD, PTSD, and we (my therapist and I) are looking at maybe BPD. I have been working on my own issues now for over three years. Supposedly I inherited my Bipolar from my dad, but I don't really know. All I know is that he didn't really believe in the whole mental health ""mumbo jumbo."" And resorted to alcoholism to deal with his problems instead. Until three years ago....

He divorced his now ex wife and has a lovely SUPPORTIVE woman in his life and has for over 2 &amp; 1/2 years. During that time, his whole demeanor changed. He was happy, there for me when I needed him, open with his feelings, allowed himself to break through the ""hardass"" dad he thought he had to be.

Well I have a 14 year old half sister (they live in Texas, btw). This is his first time actually really raising a teenager. Currently while talking to me refers to her as, ""Satan, but I love her anyway,"" as in, that's her new full name (lol). So he has been overly stressed. I guess about 6 weeks or so, he had a mental break and admitted himself to the behavioural hospital for the first time in his life. When he got out, he continued the IOP program and finished it last week.

Yesterday his girlfriend left for the week to visit her family here and I am going to Texas with her for about a week to spend time with them before my dad flies me home. He called me around 8pm, just to talk. Once we got through small talk, he started talking to me about his therapy. He told me that he has stopped drinking (his girlfriend verifies the story) and this is his first time being alone for so long and by talking to me, he was keeping him out of the trouble he used to engage in. I've drawn two and two together and I am 98℅ sure I am in his support system. I could tell he was really working on doing the right thing and he made the right call, literally, by calling me. Then we talked about therapy and how his was going and how mine is going and how we both really look forward to seeing each other next week. He told me one of his biggest fears right now is that his ""baby girls) are at the age where were could make him a grandpa. Not because he doesn't want grandkids, but he is frustrated because he isn't ready, he doesn't have property like he thinks a proper granddad should have.

I am just so proud of him. He makes me smile and I think is a really sweet family man. We just never got to see it before. He asks me if I have any regrets about him being my dad so I told him the truth. The only thing I regret is that I wish he would have been this happy sooner.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,[Happy Post] My Alcoholic Father is Finally Getting Help

25f, living with parents after college. 

The rape was in January. He initiated condom and lubless anal sex. I was a virgin. I froze and then disassociated due to a former assault (non-penetrative, of which he knew about along with my mental health conditions). He broke up with me following the sex. Before I got dressed.  After being confronted (a few days later), he's done nothing but apologize. I truly believe he did not think he was raping me. It took me 6 months to cut him out of my life, but I've had a strong history of detachment,  disassociation, and emotional abuse at the hands of people who didn't mean to hurt me (raised in a deeply fundamental baptist family with no emotional or bodily autonomy).  

I developed PTSD about a month ago (or at least that's when the symptoms hit home hard). It's to the point where I am constantly sick to my stomach, jumpy, depressed, and exhausted. I have panic attacks every day that I leave my home, and usually even if I stay. it's multiple times a day now. 

I can't talk to my family. I tried to talk to my sister (who was raped by her boyfriend while a Virgin) but she does not understand disassociation and does not consider it to have been non-consensual sex. My other sister I think feels the same but I told her that if she shared my other sisters opinion to keep it to herself). I stopped trying to talk to them after that. 

My mother is insane when it comes to sex. She's hunted my sisters' rooms for birth control before. Gone through their texts and emails. Gone through one of my sister's trash looking for condoms. You name it she's done it. She hasn't with me because for some reason, my parents either didn't suspect that I was involved with boys (I wasn't but they didn't know that) or they were too scared I'd cut ties and run. I would have. 

So none of my family really knows anything. The PTSD is bad, but I spend all my time hiding from them. It hurts me and I know it hurts them, but I can't bear the idea of talking to them about it. I won't be able to forgive my mom if she tells me it wasn't rape. I can't handle that. 

I'm afraid to go in public, especially if I'm dressed femininely or I feel sexy. I have an EXTREMELY womanly body (very big boobs, tall and slender with big eyes/lips and a young face) but I have been experiencing gender dysphoria to the point of buying men's clothes, underwear, a binder, and ""packing"" with a prosthetic penis. It makes me feel safe and right to identify as male. I fantasize about living my life as ""Sam"" and never going back to my female name. I'm not sure if this is a reaction to the rape or if I am truly bigender (it wouldn't surprise me, really), but it scares me either way. 

When I'm triggered, I have panic attacks. My hands curl up and I have things like seizures sometimes. They are scary and cast last for hours. I can't breathe. Sometimes I throw up. I've lost weight because eating has become difficult. I'm 5'6"" and 138 pounds. That doesn't sound very small, but just a month ago or so I was 144. I'm already pretty small, so it's fairly noticeable when I lose weight. But I feel huge. I want desperately to be able to eat (I feel weak a lot and I miss the emotional comfort of eating) but I'm also happy to feel like my skin is going away. Especially my breasts. I dream about losing them or cutting them off (32 FF). I keep thinking, *if I do lose more weight, maybe my boobs will go away*. I'm not starving myself on purpose (can't stress that enough, I WANT to eat). But I'm also not totally mad that my body is disappearing. 

I left my first therapist after she responded to my story by saying ""Are you sure he just didn't realize you didn't want to? It sounds like you were showing pretty positive signs."" I bled for two days following the sex, which he did not warn me was about to happen or ""prepare"" me for. It's not the first time I've been burned by a therapist. 

I've been trying to find a new one since then. I've been trying to get an appointment at the same place for almost 2 months now. Every other person that accepted my insurance was booked (mine isn't carried by many). I finally snapped with them on the phone today and cursed them out royally. I'm usually quite soft spoken and known for gentleness. But I was a new and violently angry person. It was miscommunication amongst themselves and shitty filing that led to me not being seen. They apologized and put me in as early as they can. That's 2 weeks away. 

I can't take my ADHD medicine because it exacerbates the panic attacks. My bipolar medicine (lamictal) is still in titration and it is not effective yet (and won't be for about a month). 

I am so uncomfortable in my skin and my life. I don't plan on commuting suicide, but I know I want to die.

I'm too much of a coward to kill myself by stabbing or medication. That also would mean my soul wouldn't die and so I'd still be suffering. My mind isn't the only thing that's broken. My soul is too, because of what happened.
There was also a theory that if your soul 'burns' like what happened to those people, and the man who ended up killing himself, your soul dies, forever. That also explains why there's no ghosts of SC victims. I'd like it to happen while I'm asleep. By doing this (if I manage to) I'd erase myself from existence for eternity.

I've been thinking of SC for the past few weeks, and one night, I felt this hot sensation up my spine ('kundalini'?) that lasted for a few minutes and I started to sweat.

New things in my life:

* I met a wonderful woman and am in a new long distance relationship that's about to go from interstate to intercontinental. At least the destination is somewhere I've wanted to travel to for a long time and I speak the language. I've never felt so able to be so vulnerable with anyone before. I think the world of her. And we got to spend ~~a long weekend~~ [she tells me most of 5 days does not count as a long weekend] most of a week together around last weekend that I can still get high off of thinking about.

* My dad's tumors haven't changed in size in response to his immunotherapy regimen and his tumor growth factor numbers have been going up, so hope on that front feels irrational and masochistic. 88% chance of death is still 88%.

* I probably have a job offer on the table: part time, minimum wage (with commissions, which I've always thought were a disgusting pay mechanism, but won't complain right now), and retail. But it'll be doing stuff with supplements, which I kinda know my shit on. I finished interview number 3 today and they said come back Monday to get paperwork in order and start.

* I've been slipping into a depression I've been working at fending off, but I have good counters against it (that delightful lady, potential employment, much more positive body image)

* I've been looking to give up on applying for disability but don't have the heart to tell my parents; hopefully employment would help on that front.

So now I've been officially, utterly abandoned by my small circle of girlfriends now that everyone has a boyfriend except me. So inviting me to anything is awkward since I'm the only single one. And they prefer to just go out with their boyfriends all the time anyway.
If I invite them to anything, they always, always bring their boyfriends.
My last friend to get a boyfriend didn't do that originally. Originally, she came by herself, but now she's picked up the habit to always been attached at the hip because of what everyone else always does.

I like their boyfriends and talk easily to them. But there is no sacred ""girl-time"" anymore and I'm afraid if I push them on the issue, they will abandon me entirely.

I am currently unemployed, so I am in no position to try to start dating again.
I stopped even attempting to date several months ago while my previous job grounded my soul into ash. I was happy when they finally fired me, so I finally could walk out of that hell-hole, even though I tried my hardest to please them because I hate disappointing any expectation.

So now I've been unemployed for 3 months, had several interviews, but everyone wants 10+ years experience. So in a few more months, I may indeed end up moving back in with my mother and working at walmart, despite having a software engineering degree.

I live in a small town and have no contacts outside of it. I've tried to get a job in a big city before, but they have no need of me because they already have hundreds of graduates coming out of their own local colleges.
All they do is ask you to drive up for interviews and then say they aren't interested in hiring anyone out of town, or with less than 5-10 years experience.
I've tried applying for lower IT tech jobs. Once again, they'll interview you, but won't say YES because you're over-educated and were paid too much in your previous job.


Before the soul-crushing previous job, I tried to date some. All of the guys I met fell into only two categories: They just wanted a one-night-stand or a sex-buddy. Or they were a really nice guy (usually a fellow engineer), but told me they weren't interested and friend-zoned me. They want a girl who is more artsy, super-feminine, and less like themselves.


I'm young, thin, long hair, and dress like a girl. But I don't wear makeup. I hate makeup and it irritates my sensitive skin and I just don't want to waste mornings applying it when all I'm going to do is sit at a computer desk all day long. Date nights are different. 
I'm also a jeans-and-tshirt kind of girl. I'm not the girl who wears cute girly dresses, except for special occasions.

I'm christian, virgin, vegan, and introverted. So although I'm not shy about speaking up, I do struggle to just walk into a room and make friends with everyone I make eye contact with. 

With my career going so badly so far, the idea of housewife (cooking, cleaning, and child-rearing) is sounding amazing. But I would still never be that super-feminine girl who dresses up all the time.

One of my other friends is just as lonely as me, but she has ""dates"" every week, so she never hangs out with anyone. She's so desperate she sleeps with a different guy each week, or however long the guy wants to hang out with her. We're both incredibly lonely and depressed and the only difference between us is I'm a disease-free virgin and she's had chlamydia at least once.

It makes you want to quietly kill yourself because no one would notice anyway. Your girlfriends certainly no longer care now that they've found their soulmate and everyone can go on double-dates without the awkward third wheel singleton.
Or go out and get drunk and let someone randomly rape you each night, since that's all most men think women are good for anyway. Then after that, kill yourself since at least you can claim you didn't die a virgin.

And I know every single last bit of that is anti-christian, but that's how I feel most days. If the job economy doesn't want you, men don't want you except as a sex object, and your girlfriends don't want you anymore because it's not convenient to them that you're still single, then there's really no point.

I don't keep sleeping pills or anything else in my apartment for good reason.

There is only one thing stopping me and that is the extreme pain my family will feel if I kill myself. It's not fair though. Why should I live in pain just so they won't feel pain?

I was recently all but diagnosed with irritable bowl syndrome. In March I got a really bad gut infection and my gut never recovered. Since March I've been bloated and in pretty much constant pain. My doctor wants me to do three or four more tests but once he's ruled them out he will diagnose me with IBS, which is what he believes it is. If it's IBS it's pretty much permanent and there's nothing the NHS can really do to help me. It means I will spend my entire life in chronic pain and my abdomen will always be bloated.

I've been depressed for six years now and there's no end in sight. This really feels like the final straw. I really don't want to be here anymore and if I'm going to live a life of physical pain on top of the mental pain then fuck this. Doctors tell me that the IBS isn't life threatening or anything like that. Frankly that makes me feel even worse. I would rather have cancer and die than this shit. At least with cancer you either die (fingers crossed) or you get better and improve. I'm now expected to live an ENTIRE LIFE of constantly being in pain and feeling decrepit. I feel like I've aged 20 years in the last five months.

I'm sorry to be so negative like this but I just don't see the point of living anymore. Mental anguish is one thing, but physical pain on top of it and having an abnormally bloated stomach while feeling fatigued all the time is just bullshit.

Nobody had any idea what was actually going on. Everyone was nice, but distant. Much like real life.

I've been lucky to have good people in my life, but no one has taken my well-being seriously. Nobody has really recognized my struggle.

I've been in and out of hospitals and medications and treatment centers and everything. 

In the dream, I was mostly alone. I was sitting on a balcony overlooking an amazing view of the ocean. It was one of the most peaceful things I can ever remember. Classic view of the Pacific from the west coast in late afternoon. Expecting the sunset, etc.

I was sitting there alone, and can clearly remember making the decision. I had some kind of poison in my pocket. Liquid in a dropper. All it would take is two drops in a drink. It would take 30 minutes to set in. It was supposed to be painless.

I sat and watched the ocean, which I love. Who doesn't love looking at it? I was alone. I was calm. I dropped two drops from the dropper into a beer sitting in front of me. I started drinking it...It was the most delicious beer I've ever had. I remember drinking it and thinking it was maybe delicious enough to rethink what I was doing. But then I rationalized it...Of course the beer was delicious, it would be my last one.

Then my family and old friends (I say old because I've alienated myself from absolutely everyone recently) started coming to the table. I had many moments of self-doubt, many moments of considering puking up the poison, many moments of thinking everything could be made okay.

But each of the moments came and passed. I stood by my decision, even with my father sitting at the table. My father, who, while watching me commit suicide, couldn't be bothered to talk about anything other than himself. My former friends sat and watched. I couldn't tell if they couldn't see or didn't care.

All I've wanted is a normal life. I want a job, I want a wife, I want kids. But I'm broken. And I'm too old for another real chance. My best bet is to just survive until I die of old age. And what the fuck is the point of that?

As the poison set it, it was comforting. I could feel it in my lips first. And then my gums. A pleasant, warm numbness. It spread to the rest of my face and head and shoulders and chest and arms and crotch and legs...it felt like everything was swelling and tingling...and it was becoming unbearable. It escalated and escalated and grew and spread...until I woke up in bed, wide awake, at 3:30 am sharp, which is when I wake up every fucking morning even though I'm exhausted but can no longer sleep and awake to the torture of my brain producing a slide show of all the fuckups I've ever made.

If I were 15, people would be concerned. If I were 20, people would be concerned. Blah blah blah.

When I was 12, my father passed away unexpectedly. It really really hit me hard. But a few months down the road and it felt like I was through the worst of it. Fast forward about a year, in 8th grade. I got caught with pot at my school, so my best friend since 2nd grade was no longer allowed around me. I felt so alone. So goddamn alone. I moved houses from the home I grew up in, because my mother and dead dad's parents couldn't get along. Due to the new environment, I couldn't ever fucking sleep like ever. I was up every night freaking out. You know that feeling you get when you're about to get into a fight or go talk to a pretty girl. That was what I felt for months. But, eventually, I fought my way through it, and ended up with mild depression instead of severe anxiety. The depression got a little worse and I distanced myself from my family. I decided I should go find a girl to be with, maybe that'll make me happy. So I go around I get my heart broken a couple times but then I started dating this girl a few years ago, fuck she was way out of my league and just one of the nicest people I've ever known. She really really made me happy. For a good while. Then it got pretty rough. I couldn't talk to other girls, even in school. I couldn't think about anyone,I couldn't do anything. It was unhealthy. So I wanted to end it sort of,but goddamn I loved this girl. I was stuck in a limbo of wanting to leave and wanting to fix things. That is when the depression got way worse. I would cut myself and cry a lot and freak out over nothing. And I'm not saying she was a bad person. It's just the circumstances we were in. If anything, I was the bad guy. I'd do the same shit she did, get mad over things that didn't matter, let my insecurities get the best of me. That's not the point. I just want whoever reads this to understand that the relationship was extremely toxic. Eventually in March we broke up. We were at a zaxbys and I mentioned a girl she didn't like and she started throwing food at me. So I left the building and left her. But we had broken up 100 times so I didn't think this would be much different. I started talking to this girl that ended up playing me, but my ex found out that I talked to her and asked her to prom. And then she went and fucked one of my friends, a girl mind you, and had this thing with her all to spite me. Needless to say I was devastated. Absolutely crushed. But I kept trudging along. I start dating this new girl around graduation time. My ex finds out about her and tries to come crawling back. I say no. Then she breaks up with her fuck buddy, she was fucking her just to spite me, and gets a new boyfriend. I think nothing of it. No big deal right. But I had this pain that I wanted to get rid of and I thought I could do it by doing exactly what she did to me. So I fucked her best friend. It's been about a month now and she (my ex) won't even speak to me, won't return any of my messages and honestly I deserve it. But we're both going to the same college and I've seen her a couple times and man I'm still so in love with her. I just wanna give it another shot because I've grown so much and realized I wasn't appreciating what I had. I was taking her for granted even if she was doing wrong too. I should've talked to her more about why all those things bothered her and I should've listened. I understand now what I should've done and what I could've done but I was too weak. And now I think I've lost her for good. So there's two things I'm asking for right now. How do I not jump off the balcony I'm on or how do I get her back. Because there's no fucking way I'm ever gonna feel the way I felt about her with someone else. So if I can't be with her then what's the point? Really? I love her. I still love her and I just want a second chance. I don't know how to talk to her idk what to do all I know is that I want her. And yeah, this is a cry for help. I've never felt more alone.

The amount of homework I'll be getting, the absurd amount of money I'll have to pay, finding a job so I can get books and other supplies. I've seen a few people here I recognize from high school but I'm hesitant on talking to them since none of them are in any of my current classes and I don't know any of them too well. I just plan to sit alone during my breaks for the foreseeable future. One of the things that constantly worries me is what if something bad happens while I'm here, like if I have a panick attack or if I'm called on by a teacher and my voice stops working. Another worry is what if I'm wasting my time and money and I end up killing myself before I even complete school. In short, I'm depressed and worried about all of this. However, on a more positive note, I do have plans to eventually move out once I have a job and maybe if I'm not too shy I could start looking for a psychologist since I'm currently not seeing one or taking any meds.

I'm a new mom, my daughter is about to be 3 months old. She barely sleeps and it takes about half an hour or so for me to fully fall asleep, so I get little to no sleep on any given day since I gave birth.

I'm pretty sure I have postpartum depression or its just my depression magnified by the shitty circumstances but my mother keeps telling me ""everything will be fine it's just overwhelming right now"" because there is a stigma with mental issues for her. I'm tired of having my feelings minimized and smoothed over. I'm not just ""overwhelmed.""

My boyfriend and I have been having exponential problems since I had the baby. He was not prepared to stay home, change his partying lifestyle, etc when she was born and basically left. He wants the perks of being a dad (bragging to his family, holding her sometimes, taking pictures of her for fb) but not the responsibility (not once stayed up at night with me even when he became unemployed, I can count on my fingers the number of diapers he has changed since she was born, he stayed out with his friends and got high/drunk/etc while I stayed home with the baby, then came home and was a nightmare) 

He's living in a suburb/small city north of here by an hour or so with friends who are bad influences on him and dislike me. He pays 600 dollars for a tiny room that used to be a study but is now functioning as his room because so many people live in that house. He has told me he eats once a day most days because his temp job will barely pay his exorbitant rent.

Our original plan was for him to move in with me and our daughter next week. 

In late June/July he began a fast downward spiral (he is bipolar and became manic). 
He bought a 2004 volvo with over 150k miles on it ""because it had a sunroof and leather"" ... Turns out this ""great car"" was a bust with a broken sunroof, loose A/C fan, and he was even gluing the rearview mirror back on the next day. He did not consult me or even tell me until he had already purchased it ""because I would say no."" He spent every dime he had, was fired a few days later, and was soon after disappearing to smoke, drink, pop xans, and would not respond to my messages or calls for hours and hours. 
He would come in at 2am, 4am and tell me I needed to relax, he could come whenever he wanted because our daughter doesn't sleep much and ""there is no schedule here"" 
He told me I could raise her by myself because ""girls raise babies by themselves all the time"" and ""he is 22 and young and wants to enjoy his youth""
I am almost 2 yrs younger than him and have said nothing about my own youth or sacrificing what I have for our child. 

He eventually left because he ""couldn't be here anymore."" And now is telling me he was forced out.

He did not and still does not understand what the issue is with his behaviors. He quit the Xanax but is still terrible to me and refuses to get help for his bipolar. It hurts a lot because I love him and know there is a good, kind person in there that I have seen and fell in love with.

Since all of that happened I am not sure I want to live with him. I told him that last night because he demanded I tell him whether we were doing that same plan of living together or if he would have to stay in that house for 600 dollars for another month before he can begin his old job (labor job working on the road). 
I don't want myself or my daughter in an environment that is tense or unpredictable. I also don't want him relapsing because he had told me he was self medicating and is still refusing any kind of treatment (I did however get him to agree to see a therapist, his appointment is today and I'm not sure if he will go) 

I'm so sad about everything lately and I feel trapped and miserable. 

I love my boyfriend but he's wearing me down and I can't even sleep because I'm taking care of our child by myself. I fight with him frequently but now he is pushing me away and saying I betrayed him and he's disappointed in me. I feel very alone. It is not at all how I pictured the first few months of being a new mommy.

My body is no longer what it was, I have a history of anorexia and it's been nauseating stepping on the scale and seeing I weigh 20/30 more lbs than I have ever weighed.. My belly is flatter but still very squishy and I have no energy to get out of the house let alone exercise so I'm trying to eat less. 

I feel bad about myself, my situation, my relationship, my future. 

TL;DR - depressed because raising baby alone.  bipolar boyfriend does not want responsibility only perks of being a dad and is refusing to get help for his bipolar. he is mad/guilt tripping me for not wanting to live together right now. old body image issues are surfacing with postpartum body. sad about expectation vs reality of my life situation. lonely and tired.

So I am a 28 year old dark skinned black man that has the worst luck possible. I'll break this up in parts...

First, my childhood was not so good. I was the youngest of 3 raised by a single mother in poverty. Not only we were poor but I lived with verbal abuse from my mom and it affected me since I was a child so of course it made me shy around others and it resulted in me being teased. I finally graduated high school and went to college hoping I could find a good career as my ticket out of poverty.

However, I couldn't land one single job and my grades suffered. Let me pause and tell the readers that being a student is way easier when all you have to worry about is being a student. My grades suffered and got kicked out of school. I had to move back home, back to poverty where I contemplated suicide.

But I finally went back to school, got a job, got an internship at a high ranking research facility, won research awards, and even got a publication. I ended up graduating with a bachelor's degree while living in my car throughout undergrad. I thought my life was finally moving forward.

That was until I couldn't find work in the new city where I was about to begin graduate school. I couldn't find work anywhere, not even as a janitor, although my resume is 4 years of clinical and research experience. I have the ability to do doctorate level work but I can't even get hired for anything lower or menial.

So here I am, jobless, not going to school this semester. I'm now living at my grandmother's house, sleeping on the floor with 20 dollars left to my name.

My love life is non existent too. I've never been on a date, kissed a girl, nothing. I've been rejected all of my life and it really hurts. On top of that, since childhood, I often prayed to God that I can at least catch a break or get a chance at school, a job, love. But I never got an answer after all these years. Overall, being rejected by women, hundreds of employers, AND not having my prayers answered for decades takes a huge mental toll on you.

I since gave up on religion and turned away from God. I truly hate God, society, and in general the world because of the life I got dealt. I've always been taught that if you work hard enough, make sacrifices, and keep a positive attitude, you will succeed. When in reality, social mobility at large is based on nepotism and favoritism and not merit. I've always been taught that love will eventually find you and you should improve yourself, etc. But in reality, looks and social status is most important. I've always been taught that I have to keep praying. But in reality, God doesn't exist.

All of the realization hit me at once and it is alot to take in. No matter how much I can try, I still have to endure stereotypes daily, being stereotyped by my own race, and never get an answer for why my life is this way. The cycle of poverty is REAL. Some people are born on the lowest rung on the ladder, but others have to FIRST climb out of the abyss THEN climb the ladder. It's a rigged game.

It's hard to realize that maybe I wasn't meant for love either. Being rejected is a pattern that is sometimes right. I don't believe in God anymore and I think ALOT of happiness is attributed to luck.

Finding someone, getting a career to escape poverty, having your prayers answered does have luck involved, but it seems like fate or chance always seem to skip over me..",depression,t5_2qqqf,I feel like I've been lied to my whole life.

I'm actually quite scared that I'm going to be so unhappy that I might try to kill myself. 

I feel like everything is slipping away from me. My course isn't going well, I have absolutely no interest or motivation to work or study- I know how important it is but I am just incapable of caring. I wanted to use this summer to get 'back on track', but I haven't been successful. I've been (a little bit) ill a few times, which I have used as an excuse to take pain killers which have a very strong effect on me and make me so drowsy I can sleep all day and not have to deal with being sad and awake. 

I'm shy and I have few friends, they're good friends but I can't help but feel so estranged and alone with them. It feels like a gulf is widening between us. I live with some friends, one of whom I liked as more than a friend- but he tried to use me for sex. It really stung! I'd always thought we had such a good relationship and that he would never want to hurt my feelings. He did a wonderful job of seeming genuine in his care for me. 

I feel like an alien... I can't relate to anyone sometimes. I'm so picky about people- I can always find a reason not to spend time with someone perfectly nice. I feel like I have about 500 different personalities and I have no clue who I am, no identity in the slightest. I feel like a swamp of different horrible emotions. 

I hate myself and it feels like I don't even care. I've grown up thinking everything about me is hideously wrong. I just don't know what to do.

I just wanted to make an update post about my gym journey.

Just to let you know, i havent consistently went to the gym since 2008 and havent been in the gym at all since 2011. Between 2008 and now; I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and major depressive disorder (i also have asthma, but was diagnosed at 12yrs of age).  I have had a septoplasmy, a tonsillectomy, and a  uvlectomy at this time period.  I ballooned from 220lbs to over 320lbs (im 6' 2"" BTW).  A lot of other bad things have happened to me as well including my offense. I have high blood pressure and I am pre-diabetes.

My fist goal was consistency when it comes to working out at the gym.  I cant work out a home, i get to lazy, so no home gym.  I set a goal of 3 times per week, but have been going for 5 days a week so far which is fantastic!  I go Monday through Friday during the early morning  (nobody works out during the morning for some reason).  I work out for 2 hours, mainly because of a 15min warm-up and 25 minute cardio.  I weight lift between those 2 periods.  The warm-up and cardio is the most important part of my workout.

Im also changing my diet (well not diet, im changing my EATING for good).  I havent tried drastic changes, ive made small changes here and there.  First i made myself eat 3 times a day.  Now im changing, slowly but surely, those meals that i eat.  I still eat candy every now and then, i go with candy that takes me longer to consume like jolly ranchers and life savers as oppose to skittles and M&amp;Ms.  I still eat cookies and donuts though, but no where near as much as i use to.  My goal is to completely cut out cookies, cakes (which i have cut out already), and donuts period.  I am taking my time on this.  Im eating Oatmeal for breakfast. its the sugary kind though, so i need to change this (better than shrimp flavored oriental ""crackhead"" soups).  I am baking alot of chicken  (which im thankful that i can afford), and im eating that for lunch and dinner along with a small cup of rice (white rice for now.  Is brown rice better?), and about 2 cups of veggies (broccoli and peppers specifically for now).  

Im feeling A LOT better now over all as a result of this.  Im not strong whatsoever.  Im big, fat, and weak.  But ive started, hopefully i keep working out through the rest of the year.  This is a hobby i definitely want to have for the rest of my life.  I know its not conquering my depression, i still may need therapy for this, but i believe this is a very good number of steps in the right direction.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Getting in the gym: follow up

I will mention right away that I do not have a formal BPD diagnosis, that is my self-assessment. I am currently in court mandated alcohol classes after a DUI. My counselor in the classes believes I have schizophrenia. My official diagnosis is PDD-NOS (autism) and major depression. I read the diagnostic criteria for Boderline and believe that fits me much better than any of the ones I mentioned.

That is all probably irrelevant, lol. I'm not looking for a diagnosis. I am struggling a lot lately with how to manage my feelings with other people, especially those I am closest to.

Two years ago, I started a new job and made an effort to improve my life. In all aspects, really. I had been suicidal very frequently, abused alcohol, and felt very intense and insecure, emotionally. I had also spent very little time in the workforce, even though I was 27. That led to strong feelings of inadequacy and uselessness. So, I used the new job to try and improve my work ethic, my interpersonal skills; everything really. I had been reading a lot about DBT and tried to internalize the concepts in it by myself, having burned through a mountain of meds and therapists.

At the end of the day, it didn't work out, and my worst impulses got the better of me. I had tried to give up on what I saw as my worst impulses: my alcohol and pot use, my suicidal thoughts and actions, my tantrums and violent thoughts, and my desperate co-dependency and insecurity. In all areas I relapsed with a vengeance. Got the DUI, attacked a jailer, attacked my sister, harassed then stalked a coworker, threw tantrums at work, quit the job without having another one lined up, quit three more after that. I live alone with a small dog. Outside of my alcohol classes I rarely see other people. Sometimes I want to be alone: no one to hurt, no one to hurt me, and it's very relaxing. Other times it feels downright oppressive, and I feel like I was abandoned by everyone who ever cared about me. The worst is when both seem like absolute Hell. That's just so terrifying. What never occurs is feeling equally comfortable around people or alone.

I am sorry if I am rambling. I don't know what to say. Everything feels like a challenge right now, and I don't know what to do with myself. I am struggling: financially (turned thousands in savings to thousands in debt within a year), emotionally, and just generally struggle to get through the day. I don't contemplate suicide every day. But I am at the point now where I think the number of people who would be harmed by my suicide is very small, as everyone has given up on me. I've given up on myself, really. I don't want to get better. I don't want to devote so much energy again just to wind up in Hell. I'm already there. I no longer believe ""better"" is, well, better....

I witnessed my father put my mother through a wall,knock her unconscious,put a gun and knife to her head/throat among many other things. I don't talk to anyone about these things due to myself being incredibly untrusting/damaged. We(Ex and I) have been together for 3 years, last year(2015) on Christmas day she gave birth to my beautiful daughter who i love more than anything in this entire world. 2 months after she gave birth she decided she wanted to go back to work and i supported her decision, she made $2 more a hr than i did so we decided it was best for me to be a stay at home dad. Fast forward 6 months later and she say's she's unhappy cause we're always behind on bills,I don't spend enough time with her and we don't do anything together(I'm not a fan of her family so i'd generally stay home when she'd go to their houses). The past 3 months my depression has been really really bad and i didn't say anything to her about it because i still feel ashamed of what has happened to me in my life.I'v thrown myself into video games as a way to escape the fucked up shit that goes on in my head, i took care of my daughter everyday and played games in all of my free time. Games are no longer fun and don't distract me anymore, the world is considerably darker without her around as she is such a vibrant and sweet soul. I'v told her i'd go to counseling and therapy, pay for couple therapy, do anything to fix our relationship but she say's she no longer loves me, i'm a cold person and she was ok with that before but she's not anymore. I now have to talk to her about all matters regarding our daughter when she calls but most of the time that's not what she really wants to talk about, she always leads off to anything and everything else. We ""broke"" up about a week ago and ""kinda"" agreed to work it out and see what happens. Last night she tells me she want's to get married to me next year(Leaving me happy thinking we're going to really try and fix this) then this morning she   tells me ""I'm not in love with you anymore.I just can't try and be with you"" I'v always thought about  putting my .45 in my mouth and ending my time on this cruel fucked up world, but now that's all i can think about. I'm won't do it because i know what it's like to not have a father growing up and i don't want to do that to my daughter but i really really wish something would happen to me and take me.

The only family i have left is my mother who i talk to a few times a week but we're not really close.

For example, one of my classic dumb ideas was ""I'll just go for a hike at the beginning of a blizzard, 'It'll be *fineeeee*.'"" So I went ahead on that hike and the snow came down hard enough that I lost the trail and was wandering around for awhile. Finally after water soaked through my boots to a point where frostbite was starting to be a concern I stumbled upon the road. When I got to it, I wasn't even sure which way took me to my car. After hiking for maybe 1/4 mile or something ridiculously short for anyone not worried about frostbite, I decided *hitchhiking* would be a good idea. So I put that thumb up and the first car to come by gave me a ride to my car. It really reassured me in my faith in humanity, I guess.

Another time, my psychosis had flared up during finals, and I thought that if I did something no one had ever done before I'd get to be a telepath. But for it to work it had to be relevant to my major (econ). So I combined some random new tea product and tiger balm and rubbed them into my beard. I thought, this improves alertness, which can help productivity and is therefore related to econ, so I can pass! Needless to say, I did not become a telepath.

Then there was the German-language econ textbook I actually thought I'd spend time reading and prepare to move to Germany (never happened).

Come to think of it a lot of the psychosis anecdotes I'd thought would be funny to share honestly are just plain sad =/.

I hate having to go back to school, and still struggling to even find menial labor, and this entire society and the way it screws people.

I'm just bored and alone, as always, and I see no point to it.  Earlier this week I decided to try to contact that online text support suicide hotline.  I thought, why not?  I've got no one else to talk to.  Nothing else to do.  What they told me was that I was in a philosophical quandary and to search suicide therapy.  I wasn't expecting it to help, since I already know those hotlines are only useful for a certain section of people who only need someone to listen to them.  Can't fix an entirely non-functional life, right?  I've talked to about three different lines in the past year or two, since somehow my life keeps getting worse, despite never being good.

I looked up some of the DBT articles that came up in search and that seems utterly worthless too (besides that you've got to have a way to pay for these exorbitant pieces of fluff, right?).  I spent my birthday alone, so that was the worst birthday I can remember.  I got two well-wishes online from people I talk to briefly maybe once a year.  I've spent the last two days laying on the couch.  Life seems to fucking boring.  And difficult, because every goddamn thing is difficult when you're socially awkward and look like a troll.  I marvel at the people who look like Greek gods, perfectly charming, and I'm of a different species.

I'm too old for this shit.  Too dead to even begin to study something I really don't care about, plunging into debt for the sake of it after I've already done four awful years in school.

If I was I'd probably be a lot happier. But every night, without fail, I get hit by this wall of doubt. It can happen in the day too, just not as often. The doubt comes in all sorts of forms. The idea that I've annoyed someone, that they aren't really my friend, and are simply putting up with me. I hate that. Or it comes through the idea that I've upset someone, cause they don't reply to my texts. I know they've seen them, they're online. But I shouldn't be surprised. 

I just really thought that university would fix all this. I'd make a ton of new friends. But instead I spent most of my first year in bed, without the energy or willpower to get up. I feel like I've failed, in almost everything. Everything I do is a stall, like an operation on a tumor. It might reduce it, maybe give the patient a few more months. But the cancer will always get them. Just like this will get me. And I'm so fucking sick of people telling me that it gets better. Cause I've been dealing with this for 4 years, and so far all it's gotten is worse. 

I can't go to therapy, like it would help. I was born fucked up, and no amount of reiterating that to an ""expert"" will change that. I may as well leave the appointments open to people who have a chance at being helped.

And I can't go to my parents, I can't as much as be in the same room when anything deep or personal comes up. I know scarily little about my parents' lives, it's not that I dont care, I just don't know how to approach them.

Hello,

This is my first attempt at a video blog on dealing with my bipolar disorder, and the reason I started Hope is Good.

Since this is my first video blog, I am pretty anxious and nervous. The video is also quite long, so if you are taking your time to listen to me, thank you so much for your patience.

This is the first of many video blogs I will make every week for Hope is Good, and I will try to cover as many issues about the different mental illnesses as I can.

Again, thank you for your support and patience. :)",BipolarReddit,t5_2qzru,"My first attempt at video blogging about my own bipolar disorder and starting a cause. Sorry about the out of sync audio. I'm already anxious, so please be nice. Thank you."

I made a group of friends for the first month I was here, but somehow we drifted apart. I don't know if all of us stopped hanging out and they all found new groups, or if they still hang out without me. But now I have no friends. The most human interaction I get every day is buying something from a cashier or something. Every single night, I'm alone and bored to death. I'm starting to get sick of myself because I'm spending too much time alone. 

I don't take medication because I don't have a pediatrician in my new country. I don't really need to get one because I'm only living here temporarily. I go to the gym everyday because it's all I have left to live for. But the gym only makes me feel good for the short period of time I'm there. Then it's back to soul crushing loneliness. 

Usually I'm decent in school, but my motivation to study is pretty much gone, I assume because of my depression returning. I'm always tired, and I can't focus or concentrate on anything for more than like 30 seconds at a time. I lose my train of thought extremely easily and I can't think straight.

All of my problems stem back to me not having friends and being lonely and bored. I'm also super socially awkward, so I have no idea to make new friends. And worse, my depression makes me even lack the desire or motivation to make friends.

I have a few problems with my life and I would like to write it down. If someone has any suggestion please let me know. I am all here for discussion. I am open to anything. I just need to talk to someone. I dont have that choice.

1. My lack of sexual relationship or even emotional relationship is somewhat ruining me. I recently tried using Tinder. I live in a small place but full of tourists so I thought it would be easy for me to at least find some women who would find me interesting enough to ""like"" me on tinder but damn after 3 days of liking more than 70% nothing... This makes me think I am rather ugly than average looking as of what I thought before. 

Before tinder. I was going out with a woman I meet as a client in my workplace as a saleman. I invited her on facebook, she didnt know it was me, until I pointed out. We went out a few times but due to my time schedule and maybe not too much texting etc she decided to end things. 

That the only real relationship I ever had at my 26 years of life. At least it felt real but obviously it wasnt as I thought it was. 

I knew that she was interested in a guy she knew years before. If he ever appear, she would go with him without hasitating a little bit. A bit of discussion with her made me realise that. 

Even before that 3 month relationship. WHenever I saw a nice looking woman, it makes me chuckle and makes me feel shit. THat is why I try to avoid public places hwere this nice looking women go out all dressed up with nice sexy clothes. BUt I end up going through those places because it is the closest I will get to women I like.

2. Another reason for feeling bad isthe fact that I work as a sales person in my bad s work. He made this small store that has its people. What I dont like it is that I work there with him. As a kid, I sweared I would leave from this horrible man, taking my mother with me.

I disappoint myself and my mother. She suffers as long as I live to protect me and because she got used to this type of life. She is like a slave. THe only reason I didnt kill myself till now it is because I dont want to make my mother even worse. 

3. I know I have to look myself a bit better. I have to start working out. I have to start taking care of myself. It is too hard though. FIrst of all, I work from morning to night 21:00. It is after 21 that I have time to come to reddit read some post watch a video and go for sleep. I often tell myself that I will wake up early and go for a run. But I never do. I only get more fat due to poor nutrition. I dont have time/knowleadge to make a healthy food. I buy ready foods from different places. I tried salads but salads are not for me.

4. I need to find another job. It is neough that I am not paid for the last 6 months. but again, I find it too hard to start applying after 21:00. I start making my Resume but never finish it.

I dont know what to do. Hopefully someone out there reads this and gives me his thoughts.

It is quite a few times, I conteplate joining the french foreign legion as if that will give me a new life but I am not physically fit to do that.

I didnt see him but just the idea of him being in the same area I am for continuous amounts of time made me so anxious that I decided to drop out. This guy has fucked up my life in so many ways. He bullied me in highschool the most and highschool for me was the worst experience of my life. I want to kill this man but at the same time I dont want to throw whats left of my shitty life away because of his miserable existence. He made me drop out of college by destroying my self confidence. I know almost all of my anxiety towards college comes because of him. The idea that he can bully me again makes me so scared that I fucking throw up just thinking about it. The final year of highschool was really enjoyable because the bully had finally left the school. I didnt need to be reminded of what he did to me every day of my life. He fucked up my personality and everything in my life. I cant let it go because he can still bully me.

After that i stayed far away from her, until she ran over to me with a bloody nose and a black eye crying and saying that her boyfriend hit her, driven with rage i stormed over to her boyfriends place and broke his nose with a headbutt. 


I only ever fight when its needed and to me she was worth it. 


An assault charge and community service later i find out it was actually the guy who she had been seeing behind her boyfriends back, So i kicked his teeth in and managed to get away with that. 


After that she told me she never wanted to see me again, i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety not long before i met her so i took it hard that the one person i had ever fought for pushed me away. 


She tried to talk to me a few times after that but i pushed her away. 


About a week ago we bumped into each other on the street and she had stitches on her lip, she told me that one of her boyfriends almost killed her, i took it with a pinch of salt and did some digging around until i found out it was true and he was getting six months in jail. 


We have been talking steadily since then and i have a date with her tomorrow. Now i don't know whether i should go or not because i don't trust her, but i really like her and i want to be with her. 


I just don't know, what if its just all another big lie and bad shit comes my way, but what if she has finally changed and this could be the big time. 


I would just like some advice or fresh opinions, just so i can try to make this work.

But I can't stand this mental stress anymore that everyone puts on me and I just want everything to end. My life has no purpose. My moods randomly change and everytime I think about death. In school I'm so pressured I just wanna do something/anything to myself so I don't have to go there anymore - I'm crying every night beacuse of it - I'm that scared of it. Tommorow I'm going to visit my girlfriend I won't think about these things but I won't see her for 2 weeks and I don't know if I can survive anymore with that stress. For 12 years I've been saying to my parents that everything is all right. When they asked me that do I really feel alright I told them that I hate this life and I want to commit suicide beacuse I don't want to live they just responded with ""I don't wanna hear it stop"". Yesterday I was talking with my mom about my mental problems but she doesn't seem to care. She's like ""Oh We will go but I don't have much time right now"" and today I asked her again and she forget about it - even after saying it again she's didn't care. I don't what to do really I need help. Visiting my girlfriend will help me but I won't survive 2 more weeks in this school without her. I won't survive this long with this stress and without her. I will have no other choice but to do it. (I'm sorry for my english and for mixing every part of my story)",depression,t5_2qqqf,I don't know what to do

In March I was placed in an involuntary psych ward for 50 days because I had lots of trouble with depression and suicidal thoughts. 
They told me they were surely gonna make me recover and instead put me in an isolation room because the staff didn't feel 'safe' (they told me that me being very reluctant to talk to them and always quiet was 'threatening' towards them). I slept for a week in a tiny room with the lights on and nothing to do (they took away everything I had) and basically forced me to stare at a wall for 7 full days from 9AM to 9PM. I had absolutely no human contact whatsoever for 7 full days. 

They ended up giving me zyprexa (a neurolepticum) when I got out and told me I would be forcibly put in a psych ward again if I refused to take it. It made me so fucked up that when I came back to school I couldn't concentrate.
So in short, I couldn't do shit at school from the 5th of March till the end (mid-June). 

I had to 6 exams in June (the same month I came back) and 5 in August. I missed so much but I pushed myself to my limits and studied as fucking hard as I possibly could. I did great on all subjects except for math on which I had a 24/100. They made me repeat the year for that.

Now, since I'm autistic, I really hate big changes in my life. I was already feeling comfortable and great in my class (after 3 long years). I FINALLY had good friends that cared about me and knew I had autism and still loved me as much as they did before they knew I had autism. They always helped me when I struggled with anything and especially when I didn't understand stuff. 

Anyway, so now I'm in the same class again with people I absolutely don't know and that look at me as a creepy weirdo (most likely due to the fact that I'm 2 years older than them and look like a complete autistic junkie). 

The social services of my country are also threatening to place me in a school for people with special needs if I don't magically 'get better' by the 20th of September. 

I can't stand this. I have a bone disorder that makes me 5'3 for the rest of my life (stopped growing at 10) and it makes all my bones hurt quite a lot and there's not a single cure for it whatsoever (tried many good doctors). I have autism which basically fucks my mind up and makes me the weirdest person in the neighborhood... and to finish it all off, I've also been depressed ever since I was 12 and haven't ever really felt happiness since then. 

I really don't wanna see any comments saying that I will ever get better. I'm fucked. My dad is right, I'm either gonna end up killing myself or become a homeless drug addict.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Got my highschool result on the 31st of August and found out I failed. School started the day after.

I've been so distressed and wish I never exist.

I hate my life and I've been saying ""I hate my life"" since 4th grade, look at me supposed to be in 10th grade but I'm behind in 9th grade. I hate schoolwork so much and it stresses me out.

I can't wait for someone to hire a hitman on me because once that happens, people would have my funeral turned into a party and piss on my fucking grave. There is no way in hell anybody would be sad to see me die, they'd only be sad because nobody likes seeing someone die, nobody would be sad if I die like as I was some great person.

I try so hard to be nice to people but like nobody appreciates my kindness and sympathy. I make mistakes and everyone takes those mistakes to ""YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT"", and it pisses me the living hell off. Nobody wants anything to do with me and I'm so fucking sick and tired of it.

People would only start a conversation with me if I was fucking flaming with someone that has done something to me, THATS THE ONLY FUCKING TIME SOMEONE WANTS TO TALK TO ME! Nobody wants to hang around or chill with me, NOBODY DOES!!!!

I don't have any friends IRL, just online, and I guarantee they all hate me or dislike me.

My family only cares about grades and behavior, they wouldn't care of how I feel right now because they'd get more upset about how I talk to online friends, more than how distressed and uncomfortable I am. I love my family to death, but they only want to raise me but not love on me. They've raised me well but like nobody sees that I'm a nice person.

When someone hurts me or torments me in anyway, I overreact and go fucking apeshit. I'm extremely sensitive and I don't handle things well at all. I always want to seek revenge on people that hurt me because I do not let people that hurt me get away with it.

I'm clearly ashamed that my presence exists. I hate it to death and wish it didn't exist. Nobody cares about me and I'm close to finding a way to end my life. I've been suicidal for a long time but scared as I'd scream like fuck and have people attempt to revive someone petty like me.

I can't get a girlfriend as nobody likes me, I've dated 5 people online and tried to be the most caring person ever, but they don't appreciate it. Nobody appreciates anything about me and nobody wants to completely focus on me in their life and have me as their soulmate.

Everyone ignores me or finds some stupid pitiful excuse on why they couldn't talk to me. People think I'm wasting their time when I talk to them. I know people are busy in life but like sometimes I don't believe it.

I am so fed up with living. I am extremely miserable and fail miserably at everything. I am an unsuccessful person and literally have no purpose to live. I wish someone would kill me or hire a hitman for me, to me.

If I were to like someone or have feelings for someone, they would friendzone me once I admit it to a girl I would like. Yea everyone finds a love, except for me. Everyone gets to love on people when they are a teenager, but I don't experience that at all.

I am diagnosed with major depression and adhd. Over the last... almost 2 years(? I believe) I have been on 3 different antidepressants, off and on smoking cannabis, and adderall. 

First depression medication did nothing (that I remember, my memory is hazy), second I got switched off rather quickly to zoloft, and the third, zoloft, had good effects for a month or two, then stopped doing much, but continued having horrible side effects. I quit zoloft a month ago. 

Adderall helps me focus, but not even by much, and not that that even matters if I hate my own thoughts.

Cannabis helps me focus, think clearer, not hate myself, and be less on edge. My depression is still there, and still gnaws at the back of my mind more and more until my high wears off, but it is actually bearable. The best thing about it though is the not being on edge. Constantly I am stressed, constantly I look for things to relieve the stress, but it never works. Now I don't focus on the constant lingering doom that I always feel, don't constantly feel watched, and I don't feel ""tricked"" by my own thoughts. I just think clearly, I'm not quite sure how to describe it. When I'm high, it's like I don't hate myself, and like I can actually enjoy and learn more about the world without constantly not seeing through clouded and delusional eyes.

However, less and less does being high hold back the misery. I'm starting to see that I was best when I was first on zoloft and weed. I saw my psychiatrist a few days ago, after I realized I should probably get back on antidepressants, and he prescribed me Venlafaxine. Unfortunately, I did some research and there is no way in hell am I taking that drug. I know most antidepressants have bad side effects, and you just have to weigh the pros and cons accordingly, but from what I can tell 95% of people that have tried it have said it was awful. I have a doctor appointment in a few days, and I am going to get a referral to a new psychiatrist and/or psychologist. The problem is, with the amount of time that will take to happen, and then the time it takes for a new antidepressant to actually kick in, I honestly NEED this to be a time I get a decent medication. I can't go through this again. I have been suicidal for years, and I know if I have another failure on antidepressants, I'll just be done.

I don't know what to tell my new doctor, I don't know why cannabis helps me more than prescribed drugs, I don't know if I should tell the new dr I smoke, I don't know if I'll be able to describe my own feelings properly, I just really don't know what to do about anything anymore.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,Why does Cannabis help me more than Antidepressants and Adderall?

As an undergraduate, I had no clue what to study, so I chose philosophy, which is a huge embarrassment to me now. Make no mistake, this sort of subject is a waste of three years. If you're passionate about the subject, read a fucking book, or I swear you will regret your decision if you actually pay to study it.

As the subject was not difficult for me and I knew I needed to make my time count, I started working as a prostitute through Craigslist (I am male). I have always had a latent bi-curiosity, and met a gay fellow student I trusted immensely who I confessed curiosities to, plus intended to explore my own interests online. I rapidly realized I could make money doing this.

These were the good years. I managed to save up around £18,000, and made around £500 a week. I also met a sugar daddy / mentor who taught me how to dress properly (ditched the hoodies and jeans for blazers, chinos and proper shirts and shoes). I went on holiday three or so times a year, to five star hotels. My other clients made life regularly exciting and interesting, and my career as a prostitute gave me a ton of stories and memories.

I managed to get into an MSc in a finance and accounting related discipline at a very good university.

Here is where my life went completely and totally to shit.

I started lending money to my father. Long story short, I spent a year chasing my money while learning my father is a compulsive liar and a coward. I will never respect him again. I absolutely loathed my MSc and the stress it caused more than I can express, to the point of panic attacks and pissing the bed. It was an exercise in continually struggling to perform even adequately given how under-prepared I was compared to my peers.

My partner ended up helping me with my dissertation, and managed to get me to pass with a merit largely due to a distinction in my dissertation.

I am now 25. I have been unemployed since graduating in 2015. I am facing salaries of as low as 16,000-17,000 to start a career as an accountant. It isn't even a field I have a shred of interest in, and failed at it's one purpose, which was to pay well. My savings are now down to a bit under £13,000. I have a single pair of chinos which is getting frayed, and the quality things I knew are wearing out. No computer. No hobbies. No respect for myself at all.

I feel I will never again know the standard of living I had as an undergraduate, and have no idea how I am supposed to face years of budgeted mediocrity and shit positions having had the experiences I have.

I have lost interest in life. I have seen how good life can get, and then been relegated to complete shit which is even worse than before the good years.

I am only alive for my partner. If they didn't exist, I'd burn charcoal in an enclosed space and asphyxiate myself with a smug feeling of telling the world and it's ugly fucking prospects to piss off.

I am too tired to carry on, but suffice to say: I've learned the difference between having money and not is as severe as the difference between being blind and having your eyesight. I was born blind, got a chance to see, and am now blind again. I wake up every day disappointed.

Maybe because I’m no longer too traumatized to interact with my dad (although I still won’t be alone with him). Also maybe because I just read some posts in the raised by narcissists group. But I wanted to write about my mom ...

As a kid and teen I never felt particularly smart. I think I probably felt that way because of stories my mother or our family would tell about her as a child. She interviewed their neighbors, wrote a neighborhood paper and sold it for five cents to all the neighbors when she was five. She bought a book on Russian and taught herself when she was a kid. As a teen she became a counselor at a summer camp where only Russian was spoken, worked at another camp where they spoke only Chinese, went to Germany for a year as an exchange student, where she became so fluent and had so little accent that Germans thought she was German. My mother told me that she didn’t need her parents to teach her discipline, she had it naturally. I felt like I could never finish things. I was homeschooled, which was mostly fine. Once I wanted to write a paper on legends, though. She sort of goaded me on until I was making plans to read primary sources, and then of course the project was way more than my teenage self could manage and I never finished. And she let me abandon it, rather than helping me finish or helping me get it back to something manageable. She never insisted on me sticking with something that I was learning or trying to do.

She didn’t want to come across as biased against my dad (they were divorced) so she didn’t interfere on my behalf. Once she heard my dad calling me a waste of space (in more words than that), and later mentioned it to me with a comment along the lines that she was letting me see for myself what he was like or make choices for myself about our relationship. I can’t remember it exactly, but it was something dispassionate that made it seem like the proper response to fairly severe verbal abuse is to not respond and calmly think to yourself that now you know. (As opposed to, I don’t know, defending yourself or your daughter.) For my dad to feel involved in my homeschooling he got to handle history. My not doing the work for that subject was the reason that he was calling me a waste of space, or waking me up swearing at me when I overslept, or yelling at me in his room, and my mom didn’t do anything about it. Probably because she didn’t want to have to fight with him about my education.

During my relationship with my first boyfriend there was only one time that my mom ever set a boundary, and that was when he and his girlfriend (we were poly) at the last minute wanted me to move to a city a 6 hour drive away from home with them for the summer. Even then my mom said that she said no because I seemed clearly unhappy about the idea of going even as I was considering it. I stayed out til all hours with them when they came to visit (one time I had to call my dad to pick me up at an IHOP in the middle of the night because we’d had a huge fight), and when we did come home we (the three of us-- me, my boyfriend, and his girlfriend) would all sleep in one bed. I went on at least one long trip to visit them (they lived about 8 hours away), from which I have hellish memories (my boyfriend’s girlfriend -let’s call her A- was very controlling and abusive of both of us). My mom wasn’t aware enough of what was going on with me to realize that I would stay up til dawn talking to them on the phone when A was angry with me, which wasn’t infrequent. In fact, my mom had suggested herself that I move into the basement studio apartment (with its own separate entrance and kitchen and bathroom) for the summer and work and pay rent and experience living on my own (albeit in the same building as my family). I was sixteen at the time. She told me that she had expected me to move out when I was sixteen, pointing out that one of my mentors (the mother of one of my friends) had moved out at that age. It didn’t seem like she was pushing for it, just that she was surprised that I didn’t. (As a note: I don’t think that my mom was necessarily wrong to allow me to sleep in the same bed as my boyfriend, it’s just that that was the least of it, I guess. It’s a pretty liberal stance, and she took it without seeming to pay attention to what that relationship was like.)

Anyway, I grew up in a group house, and around that time a 32-year-old (ie twice my age) man moved in with us. He became close with the whole family. He was present for the gigantic fight when my father didn’t want me and my mom to try to get a restraining order against my then ex-boyfriend (of the previous paragraph) who was stalking me and making vague references online to wanting to beat me, put me in a coma, and kill me. In fact, this man (Let’s call him B) was the one who suggested the restraining order. And when I stormed out of the house my mom and dad were facing down and B was the one who followed me and walked with me. I would go to B’s room to watch movies and talk with him. The week after I turned 18 it became sexual. We kept it a secret for months. When I finally did tell my mom she was completely okay with it. (I had to compare this to TV and movies to realize that it’s not quite right. For example, a Modern Family episode in which Haley, as a young adult, goes out with an older guy she met at her work -and not as a part of her household when she was 16- and it makes her father absolutely crazy. Basically my mom put her stamp of approval on B grooming me.)

So that’s my mom. Then there was her boyfriend. He lived with us as long as we lived in that house, longer than I can remember. He didn’t really take on parenting roles. He’d take me and my younger sister to theme parks or game halls sometimes, so I guess he acted more like an uncle. Usually he was very calm and reserved. But very (very, very) occasionally he would get mad, and then he would get really really mad. He would shake and practically foam at the mouth. Once my sister played a computer game without permission and he got so mad that he yelled and broke the CD the game was on (on purpose, like to teach a lesson). I think my mom probably saw that and didn’t say anything about it, too, but I don’t really remember. It scared me a lot, I still really dislike thinking about it.

For 7 years I've been struggling with depression.  People I would think of as friends would up and leave my life as if it was nothing, as if I was nothing.  I've never had any sort of romantic relationship.  I've been more or less alone for most of my life, and I've thought about and attempted suicide more than once.

But 2 months ago, I met someone that changed all of that.

This girl introduced me to pure, long-term happiness.  I finally knew what it was like to wake up and be happy that I was alive.  I finally knew what it was like to not have the voices and the demons shouting at me that I wasn't good enough, because I had proof that I was.  I had someone that cared about me and loved me.

But she lived half-way across the country.

I was skeptical at first but she assured me that it was okay, that it wouldn't be long that we would be together and be happy together.  And I know that it's crazy to jump into stuff like that but I believed her.  The happiness she made me feel compelled me to believe that I would have a future with this person, no matter what.  I was happy.

And then she left me.

She left me and I realized just how alone I was.  She left and I had nobody to turn to to make me feel better.  Nobody to take me out and forget that I was just dumped.  Nobody to even tell me that there were other fish in the sea.  I had nobody, and I had fooled myself into thinking that I did.

But now I do.  I have the demons again.  I have the voices shouting at me that I'm worthless again.  Except now it's louder than it was before.  Now they're gloating too, telling me that they were right and I was stupid to try and be happy, even if just for a couple months.  They're describing to me what happiness felt like because I knew how it felt now, and that made it hurt that much more.  And I'm alone with no friends or nobody to love me to silence the voices.  And I want it all to end but I don't want to die but at this point I would do whatever it took to silence them.  But I would try everything I could first.

He was my first boyfriend and he dumped me two years ago. I saw him in the library at college and he started telling the friends he was with what a stalker I am and how I'm a freak and always asked him to hang out.

I always avoided places I thought he would be, the times I did see him were coincidental and I never approached him.
When he dumped me he told me he wanted to be with me in the future which I know now was probably a lie.

I sent him 5 messages on Facebook over the course of a year. Two were apologies for the things I had done wrong in the relationship, one was months later asking if he would like to try hanging out, he said ""No I'm sorry that wouldn't be right."" I said okay. the last message was me telling him happy birthday, the message was sent almost a year ago and I haven't attempted any contact with him since then.

Now he tells all his friends I'm some psycho stalker ex girlfriend, and it hurts so much. Maybe I am stalker and if so then I really hate myself for it. I admit I shouldn't have sent him any messages but it was my first breakup and I thought he was worth trying for.
I can't move on now because I know thats how he's going to see me for the rest of his life, and now I see myself that way too and I can't help but feel unworthy of another relationship or any kind of love now.

I don't even know if another relationship is possible for me, despite me wanting one. I still have a lot of feelings for my ex and now I have severe trust issues and I can't seem to stop blaming myself for loosing him.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I hate myself so much now, I don't think I'm ever going to love someone as much as I loved him and I'm positive no one will ever love someone like me again. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life but now I'm going to be the psycho ex for the rest of my life and it makes me want to die.


tl;dr: Ex accuses me of stalking because I sent him Facebook messages five times over a year and we would see each other in public coincidentally. He's the only person I've ever been in love with, and his accusations make me think I'm not good enough to ever be in a relationship with someone else, and it's making me believe I actually am the crazy psycho stalker ex girlfriend and I want to die",depression,t5_2qqqf,Ex accuses me of being a stalker and it makes me hate myself

But, well, back to the matter at hand. I see a school appointed counselor who told me to go to a free psychiatrist provided by the school who was able to prescribe me 5mg of lexapro. He made it sound like there are zero side effects, no interactions, everything would be fine.

Only through my own googling did I find out that you can't drink or smoke weed while on lexapro, in addition to other possible side effects. Now, look, I'm not an alcoholic who drinks every day. I drink between 1-2 times a week, and smoke about the same. I've gone without it for long periods with no problems, but it's a nice time to have with friends and something I look forward to- suddenly not being able to either of those things, forever, is kinda jarring. Especially because the doctor didn't see fit to mention that, even though I'd just told him that I drank and smoked. 

I've also read that lexapro can make people's depression worse, which is scary. I'm riding the knife edge of functionality right now, if I get any more depressed I'd be a danger to myself and almost certainly not able to function well in my classes.

I have been depressed for as long as I can remember and have simply run out of options and can't handle life anymore.

The first time I got help for my depression was after my first suicide attempt around age 11, my second attempt was around age 16, and I've thought about it frequently since then. I started therapy and medication when I was 11 and have been in-and-out of therapy as well as on-and-off of different medications ever since. After years of therapy and having exhausted almost all options as far as medication is concerned, I have accepted that I'm probably not going to recover.

I won't say that I've had a terrible life, it's had its ups and downs, and I know that many have it much worse, which people never fail to remind me. I know that I have a decent life, a loving mom, dad, and brother, and a couple of friends, but none of that keeps the deep depression, negative thoughts, self-hate, and constant thoughts of suicide out of my head. Medication hasn't helped, therapy hasn't helped, talking to friends about it doesn't help anymore, and spending time with people only keeps my mind off of it until I'm alone again. My parents divorced when I was young, and I was bullied all through elementary, middle, and high school, and have never had much confidence in myself. I've had relationships with a few girls that I loved and made me feel genuinely happy, but as soon as each relationship ended, I became deeply depressed and suicidal again; I guess it never really went away. My last girlfriend emotionally abused/manipulated me for 4 years before entering what was almost a year-long relationship. The same person kept insisting that we were going to get married, then cheated on me and ended it 1 week before our 1-year anniversary. I haven't had a single day without planning my own death in the 8-months since then... No, this isn't the reason why I want to end it, but I would be lying if I said it wasn't a major factor.

I have chronic pain due to a couple of persistent injuries, I'm mentally and emotionally unable to handle everyday life due to my depression and anxiety, I have six figures of student loan debt, and don't think I'll ever be able to pay it back, therapy and medications have become a huge financial burden on myself and my family, and I have nothing that brings any form of joy to my life. I used to love exercising, but can't anymore due to my injuries, and I'm unable find enjoyment in anything else that I used to like. I've done everything I can to help myself; sought professional help, have been going to therapy, I'm on medication, I've called the suicide hotline multiple times, and I even got a BS in Psychology and am currently working on my MSW with Clinical concentration, but none of this has helped me.

I can honestly say that the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to hurt my family/friends, but how fair is it to keep living in pain just to make others happy? Not a single person that I'm close to would be shocked if I killed myself. They keep making me promise that I won't do it, but I can't promise them that, because deep down I don't believe that I'm going to get better, and I don't want to live like this anymore. I used to be such a warm and caring person, but I've gotten cold, bitter, and angry, and I can't stand to see others' happiness anymore. I've become so depressed that I don't even cry at the thought of my own death anymore, I'm actually quite accepting and okay with it, but I cry at the thought of going on living like this. Even though there are a lot of things that I'm unsure of with all of this, what I do know is that if/when I do it again, it's not going to be another failed attempt of an over-emotional teenager.

Edit: I just cut again today (the day after posting this). I haven't spoken all day to my boyfriend. When we drove home, he kept making noises. I am easily irritated by noises and he knows this.

Even though I know I need them to stay sane, he doesn't care. Nobody cares about anything but themselves. I'm sick of it. So he slammed the door and it was so loud it physically hurt my ears. I screamed involuntarily because the door slam terrified me. I have sensory issues and loud noises really upset me. I couldn't help but scream. So he, screamed back at me, ""WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED"" in this horrible, enraged, judgmental voice. A few minutes later, we were downstairs. He put his phone near me so I gently moved it away from it. It was a light, gentle toss. I don't like when objects are near me on the bed so I simply tossed it to another location on the bed... nowhere near hard enough to hurt the phone, and it was still in his reach. He grumbled at me and I couldn't hear it all because I am wearing earplugs but I know he said something along the lines of, ""it wasn't even doing anything to you"". Why does that matter? Am I forced to sit right by a phone? Who is harmed when I move it away? WHY CAN'T I JUST LIVE THE WAY THAT MAKES ME COMFORTABLE??? I AM NOT HARMING ANYONE SO JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. I cut myself after he said that. I will not forgive him.

Hi, my therapist knows about my cutting but I still can't stop or even temper the increase in severity and frequency. 

The urge is too strong. Whenever I feel the urge to cut, it feels like the very ground beneath my feet is shaky and about to give way. It feels like the world is infinitely hopeless and negative and my anger/frustration/depression spirals out of control. It must be some positive feedback mechanism in my brain or something. My cutting feels like a desperate grasping at straws, trying to regain the slightest bit of control over my life. ""See, world, you can't destroy me! I destroy myself! Fuck you!"" those kinds of thoughts. I don't believe any of this stuff intellectually, but the emotions do not listen to reason.

I'm at school and have class in 1/2 hour. I have been cutting in more noticeable places so I will have to wear a sweatshirt.

It feels like I have divided into two people. One is desperately trying to create a better life. She loves art, music, science, and nature. She used to create beautiful and cool things. She used to be funny too. She just wants nothing but the best for everyone and a long, fulfilling life.

The other one is opposite. She is fueled by rage and composed only of frustration and bitterness. She is not exactly evil, but she is fed up with everything and basically lashing out at the world for being a bad place. She feels like a super villain whose motivation for evil deeds is a deep, uncompromising pain. She hates everyone, especially the Good Me. She will do things that Good Me specifically doesn't want. 

This is why I cut on a noticeable place, because Bad Me wanted to punish Good Me for spilling beer on the bed.

My boyfriend is another trigger. I started crying last night, and felt suicidal so I made the handgun against my head gesture. (Like it looks like your hand is a gun being held to your head.) This was after an entire day of holding in and suppressing my suicidal thoughts, and after being ignored while sobbing in the same room he played on his fucking ipad. I know better than to tell people because when you tell them, they think you are doing it for attention and it makes them hate you so so so much. I dare not purposely disrupt another's day with my mental health. 

But I guess the handgun thing was enough to upset him, in spite of the fact that I wanted to do much worse. Like actually kill myself. But he doesn't care. He just said, ""I'm not a psychiatrist. I can't deal with this."" 

So I cut myself again. Partly because of frustration that I have literally no support in my life and am literally NEVER LISTENED TO IN THE SLIGHTEST, and partly out of guilt for letting my disorder harm another person. I cut for the second or third time that day. 

I was hurt and wanted to be alone, so I went on a walk. He followed me, begging me not to. He has no reason to not let me go on a walk. We live in what might be the safest place on earth and it was only 10 PM. I am 29 years old. I deserve and have the right to go on a walk whenever I feel like it, and I am not a bad person for choosing to go on a walk when my boyfriend prefers I stay home for some unknowable reason. Whether or not the people in my life want to accept this fact, I am autonomous.

Regardless, he followed me. For some reason he was not wearing shoes...? He used that as an excuse to get me to come back. ""I'm gonna get blisters if you don't turn around. I'm gonna keep following you until you come home."" What a manipulative shitty thing to do--it is not MY fault you chose to chase me in the dark, when I wanted time alone, and it is DEFINITELY NOT MY FUCKING FAULT YOU DIDN'T TAKE 1 MINUTE TO PUT ON SHOES. If he was worried he couldn't catch up to me, he could have easily taken the car as I was visible from the street during my walk.

He kept following me, so I gave him the finger and walked faster. All I wanted was the slightest bit of agency in my life. I am not a child. I need control over my life, as most adults do, in order to be happy and feel respected. But like all of my needs, this one is ignored and I am blamed for daring to even HAVE needs. ""Why can't you just be happy without any of your problems being fixed?""

At one point I desperately ran into a group of trees to shake him. He followed. I sat on a drain, enjoying the sound of rushing water blocking his accusatory, scolding, guilt tripping voice. 

This morning he asked me to look at his feet. They are covered in red, blood filled blisters. I felt guilty about it in spite of the fact that it was not my fault... and cut myself again. Right before leaving for school.

He is here with me now. We go to the same school. He is my biggest trigger but I can't leave. The best I can do is stay silent like I have since yesterday. I will not speak again to anyone in my life. Why should I be emotionally available to others when they do nothing but hurt me? Why give them the gift of joking around, hanging out, encouragement, love, etc... all these things that I do because I want to help others.... but I will not be doing any of these things again until I feel like they treat me as more than an annoying obstacle.

* If you or your family history has a physical disability that can be transmitted genetically, do not breed.

* If you or your family history has a mental disorder that can be transmitted genetically, do not breed.

* If you will not take the health of your children seriously and allow them to accrue easily preventable permanent health problems, do not breed.

* If you are not intellectually capable of teaching your children how to think and instead you want to permanently hinder their critical faculties by indoctrinating them into your pet ideologies because you know that they cannot stand up to scrutiny and you simply do not care about trying to understand reality honestly, do not breed.

* If the beliefs you indoctrinate your children with cause them to have pathological aversions to normal, healthy aspects of human existence and causes them to perpetually be in internal turmoil and self-hatred and prevents them from becoming normally functioning adults, do not breed.",depression,t5_2qqqf,DAE feel like your existence was a bad decision?

My family is made up of just two bipolar women who go back &amp; forth with believe how I feel to telling me to suck it up that's life. 
I'm so sick of hearing that. 

I always feel so alone &amp; lonely even if surrounded by people. I've yet to have a successful relationship or friendship. 
Always putting myself out there to not be enough or be too much, with so few words to console me. Not sure which is really worse. 
Friendships fizzle when I give &amp; give &amp; give with nothing in return, not even the thanks of continuing to be around. When I ask for a bit more consideration of my feelings or communication I get pushed aside. 
Even if I haven't done anything wrong just asked not to be trash talked. If someone doesn't have a vested interest in me I'm nothing to them. 


Relationships are continually fruitless, just always making me feel like I'm wrong for even trying. I want love, support, understanding, communication &amp; friendly companionship. 
The longest relationship I had was so abusive in retrospect &amp; the only one my mom supported because it's all the relationships she experienced! It's so wrong. I'm never pretty enough to be enough. I'm ""expecting too much"" to be just enough. The potential of new relationships seem like so much work,  time, energy that all feels so pointless. I don't know if it's ever going to work for me. 

There are only a few things that make me think of holding it in. Keeping it together. 
-My cat,  who's in the hospital now. The only one who's always been there for me unconditionally.  We have such a bond of understanding I knew something was wrong before it got worse. She's 13, almost 14, admittedly she won't live forever but she's all I live for. Last year after her birthday I began my will because I can't think of life without her. 
I can't see my life without her. I thought I would have at least a few more years before anything serious arose but now she's showing signs of kidney disease. It may seem dumb but I just cry thinking about not being with her. Trying to think of my lonely future,  I just can't take it! 
I planned on finishing myself when realized I might not have much time. 

As much I want to leave this world I can't leave her alone.  I'm all she has also since my family is either far or sees pets as emotional inconveniences. I'm not completely sure what to do since I had to pay almost $1000 to treat her pancreatitis, along with the cost of getting her tooth pulled or risk her not eating from pain. 
I don't want her to suffer but I don't want to suffer in this life anymore. 

-Doing performance art in drag &amp; burlesque are a beautiful dream come true that still feels like hard work. I'm still having a hard time not comparing myself to others &amp; not feeling disgusting majority of the time.  I just always feel that my body shouldn't be this way. For all that she's told me my mom should've let this accident cease before it knew this wretched world. 

-Great television, anime &amp; movies motivate me to stay up &amp; set goals so I still feel good watching them as treats instead of binging on them. I know they're great distraction &amp; entertainment that somewhat bring me close to people, even if they don't feel as strongly as I do.  It can take such a long time to finish a great series or book but can be fulfilling. 
I really just want the end of Steven Universe &amp; Digimon Tri.
-The continual push to finish all of the books I've collected over the years.  Just finishing things in my reach. 

For so long I couldn't figure out why I didn't make big goals &amp; the ones I did I couldn't completely fulfill even to myself. I don't want these lofty goals that feel like someone else anymore.  I don't want kids,  or a big family or to own a house.  I don't want a college degree that put me in more debt that what it'll earn me. I don't want those friends that can so easily just walk in &amp; out of my life. I don't want some big career to mouth off about to people wanting to size me up by how much I make. I don't want to be the beautiful person I wasn't born to be. 

I still want those simple things of supporting family &amp; friends that really listen. Not having to worry about which bill is most important. I want companionship &amp; someone to cook for/who will do the same for me.  I want to have fun performing, be commended for it &amp; have that support from friends.

I'm able to post on the forum because it's not in real time, I can think more about what I want to write\tell others...the chat it's different and it's giving me anxiety! I feel like I'm the only one different, even on that forum. And they organize meetups too once in a while, some people want to organize a meet and it's near where I live, about 3 hours far. I think maybe I can go, meet people, share my problems with them...everyone's invited. But if I don't interact on the chat, I can't know the people, and I imagine the situation where on a meetup everyone had interacted before, thanks to the chat, and I'm the only one who never entered it. I feel like I'm not able to connect and it's giving me depression.

Where to start, the black sheep. If my family had a black sheep they wanted to keep hidden away it would be me. And that is because I do not live up to expectations at all. Of my siblings I am the youngest and also the runt.

The rest of my family average around 6 feet, I am 5'8. And that is where things start. My brother is 6'4 my sister is 6'2 And most my cousins are six something, both my parents are also in this range. I am the only family member that is fully developed as an adult and less than 6 feet. Hell my nephew is 19 and he is 6'4.

So here I am 26 years old, a midget compared to the rest of the family and it gets worse from there. I'm 263.2 pounds, so I am like over 100 pounds overweight. Probably diabetic, who knows! I hate myself, I cannot look at myself in the mirror, I really can't. And I know its my fault, I know that.

I don't have a car, I don't know how to drive. I don't have a girlfriend, hell I never so much as kissed a girl. So yeah, no implication here I am a virgin. And hell even if I was not shrek I dont think I could make a girl happy. I'm four inches and half in size on that department. And to top that off, I am a grower so like 99% of the time its like one inch big. Oh I forgot one more thing I am uncircumcised so also a freak of nature too.

Id show it and get laughed out of the bedroom probably. So why am I a failure cause I can't help but compared myself to my family members and see that I do not measure up in any department. My nephew apart from being bigger than me everywhere and jacked up he has a car that he got himself and knows how to drive pretty well and has a beautiful gf too and trust me the number of discarded condom boxes is appalling.

And even if I did not compare myself, my family does it for me. ""Why dont you try to be more like your nephew?"" ""When are you going to get a gf?"" And on and on and on. And I can't take it anymore. Fuck Im a failure in my own hobbies, I can't even call myself an otaku or a weeaboo Apparently not committed enough.

I have one more class to graduate with a BA, and I have failed it two times already it. And I don't know if i am going to pass it this time. I honestly have no idea if I can do that. And even if I did, I would have a BA on IT. And I don't have a single clue what to do with it.

I thought about it, and I think its best if I just well die. Honestly i am just wasting oxygen here. Even if I could and I want to change my weight I have no chance. I seen the facebook of everyone from highschool, they are all either married or engaged by now. And I would be what 27 or 28 by the time I have a good weight. Who wants that old piece of trash with the freaky penis?

The only reason I haven't done it is because I found someone who well I dont know about this person I dont know if she likes me or not. But I am a fool, a sordid fool. We may spend time together, we may go to movies and to theme parks and we may spend hours on skype at night but I am not her boyfriend. I know that because she talks about her boyfriend from time to me.

I will tell her how I feel and i know she will either just wants to be friends or to cut me off. Either way I let myself be deluded, to believe I could be happy. All I want is to leave a note and say goodbye to everyone. I live with my mother and she is old and will not make much longer. When is out out my sister and brother have told me that they will not help me that I am on my own on the streets.

I can't hurt this much more, and I've been thinking what is the least inconvenient way to off myself. I dont want to incur costs to my family, like funeral and if there is no body there is nothing like that. I thought about taking a cruise and jumping overboard at high sea during the night. I'd prob drown since I dont even know how to swim.

But hell not even that can I do right, I fail even at that. I have no funds for such a thing. This is not the tale of an underdog who gets a second wind and ends up in the top ten of his class. This is real life and I know that I'm headed to living next to a dumpster if I am lucky. And i just want everything to end.

If you are taking the time to read this post, I wanted to say thank you for showing that you care enough to read a strangers story on the internet.

I have depression for as long as I can remember. Hell, I probably had it since I was 11 years old, but never really got the chance to open up about it to my parents because of my fear that they will completely reject my feelings. I love my parents, always have, but they weren't always perfect back in the days. They were refugees from Vietnam, and after the war, they had to completely start all over. Mom was raised in a farm-like enviroment, while my Dad was a spoiled rich kid who decided to join the army. I won't go further into detail about them, but they have come a long way. 

Long story short, Dad worked his ass off so he can pay off school tuition for my Mom, and provide for my older brother. She graduated with an AA degree, became an accountant, and shortly after, I was born. 

Being raised in a Asian household was really tough since their level of education wasn't that great, so when it comes to raising kids they weren't able to apply positive reinforcement since they didn't have the chance to learn it in school. I honestly blamed them for quite a long time, but as I got older, I stopped blaming them. I stopped blaming them for repeating the same mistakes their parents made when it comes to raising children. It was not their fault that the stress they accumulated have gotten the better of them. And they realized their mistakes, like, holy shit.

I know that some of you can relate to this, but when your parents admit their mistakes and wrongdoings to you, it's like the whole weight of the world just lifted from your shoulders. That's when I stopped blaming anyone for my shortcomings, and took responsibility how i reacted to them. Too bad it didn't cure my depression, but it did give me a slightly better outlook in life. 

*sigh* Now, back on to my circumstance. I am a 22 year old male student who is still attending community college, and have a couple of quarters left to finish his pre-req courses before applying for nursing school. When I started college at 18, I made a really bad habit of skipping classes and thought everything was completely pointless. It wasn't until I started noticing my drug habit, and that I had an anxiety attack that I needed to do something with my life. I didn't start getting my shit together until I was 20 years old. Fortunately, I went from  a gpa of 0.28 to a 2.92 in the span of 2 years, so I have that going for me.

I do have a job, but I'm working super part time, and I haven't worked for a few weeks. The hours are super flexible because I work as an event staff where I can just call in to be scheduled. Honestly, the job is pretty cool so I don't hate it at all. 

I am, however, overwhelmed by a monsoon of anxiety and depression. I can't work too much, because if I do, I won't be able to get financial aid for, nor would my family be able to get housing. My mom is the only one working while my dad is unemployed. My brother was falsely accused of rape and has been unable to get a job for a really long time. He's married, but his wife is arrogant and manipulative. She's completely arrogant and neglectful. She refuses to go to a pediatrician for my baby nephew's skin problem. He's also underweight and I worry about his health. I don't know whats going on her head, but she think it's completely normal and not her fault. My brother does his best to be a father, and I can see that.

It goes without saying, this is a throwaway.
I've grown up in an abusive household all my life. My father was an alcoholic with anger issues until I was 13. I was beaten often, and threatened constantly that i should never tell anyone. Now he completely denies this happening. Since then he has absolutely nothing to do with me. I see him a couple times a week around the house, but most of the time he buries himself in work and watches TV.
My mother can only be described as a sociopath. The only thing she has ever done to me is manipulate, degrade, and verbally abuse me. To give you an idea of who she is as a person, once when I was 6 years old I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat for dinner. After asking twice and I still hadn't came to a decision, she switched her car into oncoming traffic to play chicken with a semi at 70 mph. Another time when I was 9 she left me in her truck for 7 hours while she was at a meeting with the instructions of ""If you get out I'll have your dad beat you"". after she got back I asked if we could go somewhere so I could go to the bathroom. she said no, I complained and she unbuckled my seatbelt, drug me over into her lap, opened the door, and tried to push me out onto the freeway. If I hadn't grabbed the seat belt and wrapped myself with it I think she would've succeeded.
When she found out that I had made a friend in school in the 5th grade she lost her shit (She didn't allow me to go to recess or lunch. I was to stay inside and write lines or do math worksheets instead). She pulled me out of public school and made me start doing online school.
You combine online school with the fact the nearest town to us is over 30 miles away and the closest neighbor is 11 and it's not surprising I have no friends. I have a sister, but she is basically dead to me. She lives 2 hours away and when growing up took part in helping my mother ruin me emotionally.
I'm 16 now, and you can guess that I can't drive. My mom said a license would ""get me into trouble"" and my dad, wanting to avoid a fight, agreed. The closest to human interaction i get is a couple secret social media accounts, but I haven't been out and seen anyone in longer than I can remember.
I've got less than no one. There's not a single other person on this earth that even knows I exist enough to care about me, and I haven't cared about myself for years.
So, If I haven't gotten a girlfriend or been kissed (hopeful, for someone that doesn't even have a regular friend) by my 17th, I am going to take my car (my dad got me a project car to work on a couple years ago.), drive to the funeral home, curl up in the back seat with my winchester 94, load up one round of Herters 150 gr. 30-30 soft point ammunition, and at 12:01 AM November 19th I’ll finally do something right. I’m not worried about keeping damage low, because my note will include a couple of the old country songs I want played for the few people that might feel obligated to come to the funeral, and the fact I would like to be cremated.
I think the strangest part is that I always thought setting a date would be scary, but all it has done is finally give me some peace.

I got so used to dissociating during sexual encounters with him because my brain couldn't process the pain and discomfort I was feeling. I was aroused and confused and because of this I felt ashamed. For years I have connected the feeling of arousal to shame and because of this I haven't been able to be intimate with a person since. I am now 18 and beginning to explore an intimate relationship with one of my best friends, the first person I have been intimate with since my abuse. I feel safe with this person; she knows, to some extent, the trauma that I have experienced in my past, and is incredible with communication. I know her main goal is to make sure I feel safe and comfortable, but sometimes my abuse stands in the way of me being able to enjoy sex with her. I am madly in love with her and find myself feeling comfortable being vulnerable and intimate, but when things start to get heated I will still occasionally dissociate, even though consciously I know there is no threat. I think it's just out of habit, and because of this I tend to feel very disconnected from myself after we're done. I've explained this to her and she understands it's not her fault that my brain is waving red flags in a situation that isn't dangerous, but instead the fault of my abuser, I just wish I knew a way to recognize the signs that I'm going to begin to dissociate before it happens. It doesn't happen every time, and that makes me hopeful that we don't have to stop being intimate with each other altogether. I'm in trauma counseling now but I was just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience when being in a relationship after going through sexual trauma, and if anyone has some advice on how to recognize your own triggers and stop yourself from dissociating or falling back into the old defense mechanisms that you would use when you were abused.

i've been working out for a couple of months now.  i have strained (i think) my chest, so it hurts to do bench press (for scumbag meatheads like me, this exercise is essential).  It also hurt to do pull-ups as well for some odd reason (weight assisted pull-ups of course; I'm 287 pound fucking fat fatty). took a week and a half off (i was taking Aleve once every 6 hrs) and it was feeling better, so i got back in the gym to work on chest.  I felt the strain, but it didn't hurt, and i went very light on the weights.  it was a good work out; that was yesterday.  

today i decided to work out back.  i was doing wide-grip, weight-assisted pull-ups (i'm to weak to lift my own fucking body weight and i'm to big to pick my body up with my back).  i felt the strain; it was more intense than the chest workouts yesterday, but i kept intensifying my pull-ups by reducing the weight (which in-turn, causes me to pull-up more and more of my body weight)&lt;--------- this is sign of a degenerate scumbag.  I pyramid from 130lbs assisted (meaning i was pulling up 287 - 130 = 157lbs) to 80lbs assisted (287 - 80 = 200lbs). I felt something pull at my 6th rep and a straining (hopefully) pain, so i stopped my pull-up workout there.  

i kept working out my lower back (deadlifts and back extensions) and i worked out my biceps and then power walked for 30 mins.  i was unhappy throughtout the rest of the workout, but i kept focused.  i decided to weigh myself and found out that i havent lowered my weight since i started working out, so im working with a zero-sum.

It was the first time I've ever spoken really frankly about it. I was very honest about it, as well as about feeling suicidal, and I received a lot of support and suggestions via PM that I come here to talk if I'm feeling bad again.

Well, I'm feeling really bad. Yesterday, 27th of September was my mum's birthday. I received the usual guilt tripping Facebook messages from family members about how much she misses having me in her life. Guilt tripping phonecall from my sister about how my mother 'waited to hear from me all day'. These are all people who know about the accusations I've made and take her side without question.

I know why they do. She comes off as a saint and I was a genuinely horrible kid. Thing is, I wasn't a horrible kid for no reason. My mum was having sex with me. Before she started I was such a good kid and looking back I can see how that eroded, I went from being the quietest boy in class, doing my homework, curious about the world, to shut down and angry and causing trouble wherever I could. So most of my family - all of my family thinks I'm worthless and she's a saint for having put up with me all that time, and any accusations I make are more of me trying to cause trouble for the sake of it, being spiteful. 

I'm also gay and Northern (British) so I've got a nice gaggle of homophobic aunts and uncles saying how ungrateful I am when she's been so accepting of my lifestyle.

In the early hours of this morning I went through and blocked every single one of my family on FB but it just feels like a defeat. She's the pedo and the rapist and she gets to keep her family and I'm all alone. I barely have friends. I don't know how to relate to people anymore. 

Last night I made a plan to kill myself, and then I didn't, I went on my block rampage instead. The problem is I don't know what to do today. It's such an effort to get out of bed again. I'm afraid to kill myself unless I fail, end up in hospital where she can turn up at my bedside with little to stop her.

The worst thing, and I do know I'm not the only survivor to struggle with this, but the worst thing is I miss her. I miss her, she's my mum. And she doesn't even care enough about me to admit what she did. It isn't as though she innocently overloved me and overstepped her bounds, she took my 14 year old penis and put it inside her when I was frozen, unmoving with fear. She knows she had sex with me, even if she doesn't see it as rape. And she , my mum who claimed to love me more than anything in the world, she calls me deluded, cuts me off from my entire family, acts the wounded party. 

I want to start dating again. I stopped after my first serious boyfriend, who was completely freaked out by my history when I told him, but I'd like to have someone again. Years of anonymous hookups that I never enjoy - more self harm than sex. I want to date again, but I don't know how. To be ready to tell someone I'll have to be attached to them, if they run like the hills like the last bf did I don't know what I'll do.

(tweaked from a comment I made elsewhere on this sub)

---------

* **Understanding &amp; controlling mood swings**: be mindful of prodromal behavior and focus on using behaviors that lend themselves to the direction you want your symptoms to go. Want to be active and stave off depression? Drink lots of coffee. Want to prevent hallucinations and scary kinds of mania? Go to bed early and take melatonin to ensure sufficient sleep.

* **Learn about symptoms**: For me this meant: take an abnormal psych class, spend dozens and dozens of hours researching medication and treatment options, do enough research on treating bipolar to get published. Generally wikipedia, NAMI, DBSA, and google scholar are your best friends for this.

* **Recognize moods**: Keep a mood tracker and customize it to identify individualized warning signs. Watching weeks worth of porn in a single day and barely getting sleep? You might be manic. Unsure? Come to bipolarreddit and ask for opinions; proceed with caution. [The Altman Self Rating Mania Scale](https://psychology-tools.com/altman-self-rating-mania-scale/) is a solid option, too.

--------

* **Distinguish symptoms from the real you:** Realize that symptoms *are a part of the real you* but that you don't have to let them define you. Remind yourself that you do what you can to stay in control and that you take responsibility for the mistakes you make that are partially attributable to your disorder.

* **Identify triggers**: Go to therapy religiously and listen when your therapist notices a pattern; keep an eye on your mood tracker.

* **Improve coping**: trial and error, talk to people with the same problems and hear what works for them; post to bipolarreddit asking how people cope with the same problem. (it turns out you rely heavily on distraction to cope with breakups, which there's *absolutely nothing wrong with*; I'm just hoping to fast-track this and don't think distraction'll facilitate that)

-----------

* **Avoid things that make you feel worse**: 1. identify what makes you feel worse 2. convince yourself it's important to avoid those things or figure out how not to let them make you feel worse 3. execute your plan and stick to it; don't beat yourself up when you falter, keep trying

* **Don't let your emotions control your thoughts**: stay aware of what biases your emotions are prone to distorting your thoughts towards in a given moment and screen your thoughts for their possible presence. Don't be afraid to talk to your therapist for help on this or to come to other bipolar folks to screen for cognitive distortions and irrational beliefs. Or in my case: have multiple psychotic episodes in which every time you have a thought about someone it gets analyzed by a hallucination so you become ***painfully*** aware of how your acting on your thoughts could make others feel.

* **Stop avoidance &amp; procrastination**: wait, the book just told me to avoid things though. ~*dissonanceeeee*~ (mostly being playful here). 1. identify when things are piling up and avoidance becomes problematic / unsustainable. 2. come up with an incentive system to make it suck less. 3. ***use SMART goals (small, measurable, actionable, realistic, timely)*** 4. TRY 5. TRY AGAIN 6. Find comfort despite failing and keep trying

* **Regain control when you feel overwhelmed**: 1. Identify what's overwhelming 2. see if you can break it into pieces that are more manageable. 3. ask for help 4. take a break to reset your distress tolerance so you can go back to being able to remember what feeling good feels like. If this means smoking some weed, take a nice long toke. 5. Work a little bit at a time at getting it off your plate to feel less overwhelming. (I could be better about this one and need to do a better job chunking and reaching out to get papers I've lost &amp; stuff)

* **Change your negative outlook**: surround yourself with positive people, keep healthy outlets available, stay social, be proactive about changing your meds when depression pops up, read /r/upliftingnews, frequent /r/Eyebleach, don't watch the nightly news.

* **Analyze your thoughts**: practice techniques you learned in therapy, identify distressing thoughts and challenge them by looking for flawed assumptions. Meditate, see what thoughts keep popping up, and ponder why your mind goes back to them and what you can do to ensure these thoughts go in a healthy direction in the future.

* **Work through denial about needing medication**: do research that shows medications have efficacy and that self-medication can fuck things up (google scholarrrrrr). See what happens when you forget your meds. Feel either conspicuously amazing or fantastically shitty? Remind yourself your meds are doing something. Think you're better off without meds? Come here and read stories about what happens when people go off meds. Read posts by users talking about their symptoms after going off medication, listen to their psychosis, and remind yourself that could be you. I accused my mother of drinking when she was pregnant with me and my girlfriend at the time of keeping me as a mentally deficient pet because I wasn't taking medication for psychosis. Seriously, all you need to remember medication is important is to see how much better you feel after a good med change and to read posts from people who aren't taking their meds.

* **Improve medication consistency**: see the previous bullet point and then get a med tray. Bonus points for setting an alarm or generally taking meds the same time every day.

--------

* **Effectively solve problems**: Identify problems and utilize coping skills. Ask for help as needed. Put effort into maintaining healthy relationships so help is available.

* **Strengthen stress management skills and healthy habits**: identify poor stress management skills (such as drinking feelings away), identify why those skills get chosen, and come up with substitutes with better outcomes. Alcohol makes me depressed? Smoke weed when it's available instead. Have too many stressors on your plate? Find ones you can let go of or de-emphasize. Binge eating negative feelings? Count calories and come up with foods that give the most good feeling per calorie. Decide which health risks are worth taking and which aren't; balance risks with protective factors (e.g. alcohol &amp; exercise).

* **Make better decisions**: identify poor decisions and factors that led to them. DBT chain analysis is a good option for this. Avoid situations that compromise your decision making capacity. Get enough sleep, stay in therapy, keep people around you can ask for advice from.

* **Maintain your gains**: ~~set your calorie counter to weight neutral goals /s~~ go back over your skills periodically, be compassionate with yourself when you fuck up, keep trying, be proactive and honest in managing your medication, stay active in a support group so you get practice going over coping skills for when you need them and so you have help readily available when you need it before you fall too far.

So, I'm not diagnosed BPD but I have traits and have been doing some CBT and DBT for depression and other stuff. One of the most borderline things about me is that I split.

Sometimes it's only a week apart, but often longer.

I feel that it was wrong that people got and get away with it, and if the least I can do is call them pieces of shit for it in my head (or out loud), then I want to be able to have that.

I couldn't tell her to drive back, so i kept a poker face until she left on sunday morning. I tried my best to finish everything.

I am writing this mostly for my sake, you know, as a vent. Though I got the awesome idea that if I post it here maybe I can get more support or even better help one of you. Without further wait let me begin,

I have been suffering with depression ever since freshman year of high school (currently a senior). I have had my ups and downs, fair share of the terrible and amazing, alongside many nights I wish I could repay. Yet that is all in the past, what I wish for now is the now. I spent a lot of my high school life 'failing' - I dropped out of student council, cut myself, quit teams, and left many big college prep courses. In general even though I like school - I just feel it is a reminder of my inner defeats, and I can see I haven't come to peace with them since every day I feel like I want to run away.

I am in no position to really complain about my life. I would say I am extremely lucky in many ways. However negativity for me is like a nebula, a plague. When it let it run loose it will tear down happiness, gratitude, and hope alike. This has made me slip frequently and have a distorted lends. 

Just last weekend I stooped very low mentally, the anger quickly invading my mind. I am not going to state the method I was planning to do for safety - yet the fact was that I had a full blown plan in set. I was ready to die and end my life. I have often assumed that if I do not kill myself, I will do harm to others. Sort of like the more I keep breathing the more evil I become. 

Yet that was when in my deepest moments, which happens every time I am depressed - I think of one decision,

'I hate my world. So I will decide to change it.'

I am just a human like all of you. I have my quirks here and there, yet I cannot help but be extremely energetic at the thoughts of ambition and/or projects. When I sit there and cry that I am in school or not moving forward. From sitting at home and binging snacks while consuming entertainment, I know deep down I can change all this. This sometimes makes me more guilty, yet at other times it will shoot me out on my ass.

Reddit, I have faced some issues here and there. Most are self-created such as wanting a business up and running by 20 and finding another path other than the usual college --&gt; job. A big thing I have always dealt with was my strength as man. Funny to write that down, you usually don't voice those kind of struggles - yet is a very real thing for me. 

I was raped when I was a kid and that seriously shot my self-esteem down. I remember even trying to 'kill' love in my life. I would try to get everyone to hate me, and I couldn't stand for being around anyone. Even though all this happened, I can still stay here and smile with a mix of happiness and sadness and know that I managed out of it alive.

Even though I may slip a little one day, the journey still continues. Depression may be by my side for my entire life - yet I intend for a new era of my life to begin, where it is my ally. To all of you here I write to say that I have chosen life, even if it seems hard at times. Even in the darkest hours of my world - I will - decide to change it for the better!

But college towns tend to dry quickly. I stopped finding it around January.

In March, I got on lithium and lithium has had me having strange effects to all sorts of drugs (alcohol, weed, lsd). So I really don't do anything drug related much anymore just because of the interactions. But I got diagnosed ADD in june. I was put on strattera which was $70 per bottle. It was out of my price range. Now, I'm on adderall. The adderall isn't working like it did the few times I took it before. I'm not sure if it's the lithium or the low dose, but it doesn't feel like it's working and it makes my vision weird. Like when you stare at one thing too long and look away the patterns follow?

I can never have the memory of a college girlfriend. I can never have the excitement of young love. I'm almost done with college. And every time I see anything even remotely related to love, I shut down and turn away. It makes me ragingly jealous and hopeless to see everyone else. They're better than I am. 

If my life were a video game, I'd have reset by now. I started off wrong and I want to go back and undo my mistakes. I waited too long, I got too nervous, I fucked up. And now that fuckup will hound me until the day I die, and it will always hang over my head, and I can't get it out of my head. 

I imagine talking to myself in high school. I imagine screaming at him. Punching him. Beating him to death with a baseball bat. That fucker ruined life for me and now I'm angry all the time. 

I can't function anymore around normal people. They know. They all know. I know they know. I know they see me as what I am: a 22-year-old manchild who can't get his shit together. I am deeply, deeply ashamed of what I am, and if I'm going to be this for the rest of my life, please kill me now and save me the trouble. 

I've cut off all contact from high school. I thought, maybe if I can stop being a virgin and a loser in college, I can come back and reconnect at their level. But I will never be at their level. I am still a loser. And they're beyond me. And they know. They'll treat me like a kid. They'll coddle my feelings. I want to be a man, and life keeps telling me I'm not ready. Well fuck life.

They tell me that I have to love myself. Well that's the catch-22, isn't it. I can't let up. I can't let my guard down. Every time I take a break from my goals, it's another year wasted and another year regretted. 

""Stop defining your self-worth by your love life,"" they say. What they mean is, since you failed, lie to yourself and say it doesn't matter. And they don't know shit. They got their fulfillment from something I can't have. They don't know what it's like. Because they didn't FUCK UP. They did not do the horrible things I have done to myself that warrant self-loathing and suicidal thoughts. 

The truth is: I am a failure. I am a lesser human being. That is an objective fact. Other people can do things that I can't, and I resent them. I want them out of my sight. I want to forget that they exist.  I either have to live with it, or kill myself. I'm doing the former. 

Please tell me that I can change my past. Please tell me that I can break time, go back and have the youth I wanted. Because if not, it's hopeless. Life is forever pain. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,The things I can never have are driving me insane

But it is just so stressful. It is really hard to show emotion, although I have so many. I'd love to express them, but I am scared of how people will react to it. So I don't. I care too much about other people's feelings and don't want to hurt them, so I barely talk to them, which makes me look aloof to others. Although I don't have an inch of self-esteem. I just pretend to have. And it's so tiring, that I always want to go home.

  so. obviously less sleep can trigger mania (looking in the mirror through the looking glass...). but first is everyone even those without alleged ""bipolar"" susceptible to this? if a normal person stayed up for 4 or 5 days would they go manic or would they not be able to? 
 
 what came first? does impending mania trigger less sleep or is it less sleep which triggers mania or is it a perfect storm?

 
 and also i keep sleeping for maybe half an hour in the evenings despite not being tired (getting 1-3 hours at night, but at 8ish napping for half an hour for some reason). is this just my body breaking? hahaha
