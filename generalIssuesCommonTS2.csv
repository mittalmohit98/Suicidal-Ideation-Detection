Have no clue what it could be, or if it's just my imagination. But yeah, there's this sort of heaviness (especially on my legs) that I can't explain, and it freaks me out. Not to the point where I have difficulty moving my legs, it just feels like I have a few extra layers of blankets on, even though I don't. I have to fall asleep with earphones, for a number of reasons, but mainly because the music helps calm my fears and I'm afraid of the random noises I would be hearing otherwise; I have a timer set on it so that after one hour, the music stops playing. This usually works since I can fall asleep within that time, but not lately. I have to sleep with the covers over my head for fear of seeing something scary in my room. I am TERRIFIED of someone breaking in and murdering us. Not to mention I've been hearing weird sounds through my headphones – not sounds that seem to be coming from the music, but elsewhere. It almost sounds like someone is talking over the music in a very deep background voice. I often hear other noises as well that sound like they're coming through the headphones, though they aren't a part of the song I listen to. And this usually doesn't happen, but last night I was having trouble breathing as well – have no clue why. Maybe it was just because I was freaking the hell out.

I don't know if I'm going crazy or what, but I would appreciate a few weigh ins. The lack of sleep is starting to take its toll on me, and I'm having trouble functioning throughout the day.

I went through it. It improved a bit. I only need 30 minutes to get out of bed now, and I can get out of bed before noon. 

I can do some sport. I still can't talk to people. I still can't work.

But during those years, I went through college, and I just got my engineering degree. It was a nasty fight. I didn't have any drug to help with my depression. I was alone. And I did it.

But now, I want to make an appointment with a doc. The reason is very simple. I can't function normally anymore. I don't know if it's because I have flaws of character or if it's because I am sick. So I will tell the doctor everything I'm going through and she will tell me if I'm a hopeless loser or if I'm fine and I'm a normal human being who is just sick.

Thank you for reading.

UPDATE : it's the silliest thing. I keep doing tests to guess if I'm depressed or not and they all tell me I'm severely depressed. I do some on the internet, so they might not be accurate and trustworthy. But I do some tests from books about depression that I trust, like feeling good from david d burns, and it just told me I'm severely depressed. My score is even worse than it was 2 and a half years ago when my depression first stroke! Yet, I feel silly asking for help. This must be nothing. This must be me being too lazy. Surely this is nothing serious. I have the highest troubles convincing myself it's actually worth it to schedule an appointment. I mean it's surely nothing.

I tried 10mg of Celexa and after a month it had no effect. Then 10mg of Lexapro, seemed to help me actually for like a month, then it didn't so they increased it to 15mg last week. 3 days later I was very depressed and had constant suicidal thoughts. I called my doctor after that lasted more than a day and he switched me to 100mg of Zoloft, currently on day 4 of that. 

However I still feel very depressed on top of the anxiety. I've lost interest in my hobbies though they are coming back a little. The constant thought of quitting my job is in my head, even though prior to last week I loved my job, I've been there for 9 months, and it was actually helping my anxiety.

It's my senior year of high school and I have a good family, a handful of good friends, I'm doing well in school, and heck, I even have a girlfriend for the first time, and she was literally the one person I wanted to ask out for two years, so it literally doesn't get any better than that.

Often I think I'm untalented, stupid, and just not that great of a person; and whenever I'm with friends, I feel like a ""loose end"" or ""extraneous,"" and generally just feel that I don't belong. I mean, I'm even afraid to just walk up to my girlfriend at school because I'm afraid I'll annoy her or anyone she may be with at that time. Sometimes it gets so bad that I worry she doesn't care about me. The stupid thing is, I know I'm being irrational; many of these things are things I fear most, fear of mediocrity, fear of being alone when surrounded by others, the fear that I'll annoy people if I talk to them. After all, many of these feelings and paranoia revolve most potently around my girlfriend, the person who is the least likely of anyone to harbor some kind of secret resentment, but the person I fear would the most. And yet I can't stop my fears from becoming a twisted sort of reality, and every few days, they continue to infect me. I'm even afraid to tell anyone about this because the frequency of these ""attacks"" makes me afraid of burdening them. I don't know what to do; I periodically have to struggle not to act on these feelings, and every day, they come back to me. Do I just have to keep fighting this thing for the rest of my life?

I have a plan, and the primary reasons I’m not killing myself right now are the people I care about (Very few) and some hope that it could still get better. 

I have a graduate degree in counseling and I help people with depression as a part of my job. I am proud of the work that I do and feel confident that I make a difference in my clients’ lives. But I can’t seem to fix my own depression. It’s hard to tell the people I help that it can get better and there are strategies for reducing depression when I can’t do it for myself. I am currently on two medications for depression and ADHD (Trintellix, 20mg; and Vyvanse, 70 mg). Overall, my life is objectively really great. I have a job I love, a supportive boyfriend, a delightful dog, and I’m financially stable (My student loans do cause some stress, but I can have them paid off in about 5 years). 

I do have a lack of friends. This has been the case most of my life, but I do have my boyfriend, who I live with; two close siblings, who live about 2.5 hours away; and a trustworthy friend, who lives across the country. I recently moved to a new city and haven’t met any friends at work yet or in my town. I’ve tried to look online for clubs or groups to meet people, but nothing really seemed interesting to me. 

I’ve tried to go to a counselor a few times, but I didn’t feel like she was very bright. She didn’t provide me any new insight or possible solutions. I know it can often take a while to find the right therapist, but I find it difficult because I work from about 7:30-5 everyday, which of course is when most counselors are available. I don’t know how to get help. I feel like I may need regular counseling from a respectable therapist, but I can’t take a half day off work once a week for an appointment. I don’t know how people with professional jobs get the help they need. 

The main thing I’m trying to tackle now is my depression on the weekends. I enjoy my job and get a sense of purpose from it, which helps with the depression. I think the fact that I’m busy for most of the day helps as well. But then on the weekends, I’m very sad. Sometimes I just cry and cry for no reason but an overwhelmingly strong feeling of sadness. I don’t really have any negative thoughts that I run through. It truly is just an overwhelming feeling of sadness. And I’m starting to feel hopeless that it will ever improve. Overall, with my life circumstances, training, and medication, I should be able to tackle my depression, but I can’t seem to be able to do it.

Friday was the day this specific depression had started, My mom called me upstairs onto the couch, my parents are divorced and my dad was coming to pick me up soon, on that day he was about an hour late. My mom started lecturing me about grades. I don't have bad grades im an A/B student. Halfway through my mother talking to me I stopped. I stopped listening, and I looked out the window in front of me. She kept talking, I just stared forward, I don't know hoe long it was. She started screaming at me to wake up. i started crying. She is still mad, my dad had arrived she went outside to speak to my father. It was at this point where I felt my body going into a total shutdown. Ever since then I've done nothing. My dad tried to get me out of the house when i had TOLD him im not ready... he pulls me outside anyway. He takes my whole family to a pumpkin patch near my home in Iowa. My family had been preparing for Halloween, I had stopped myself from letting myself cry in public. Eventually, I talk to my dad and ask if I can go sit in the car, he had told me what I had said angered him, and that I had been ruining the day for my family. For the rest of the day I kept my distance reflecting upon every fucking detail of that interaction. Finally we were done for the day I had gotten in the car and a few tears crept out of me. when we had gotten home I went up to my room and could do nothing but scream into my mattress. I cried.

I was in college, so it was hard to be always alone and suffering in silence.

Now I moved back to my parents' home, and I have been robbed from that place that I needed to go to when I felt bad. Now I only have my bedroom and I don't have such a place to go to.

Also it must be a park or something with trees (nature) and far away from any human activity.

I used to use a football field before. It was far from anyone and any activity. I would sneak into it at night (it was an open field very easy to get into) and I would crawl into a ball in a corner, protected from the outside by a piece of plastic that would get over my head.

&amp;nbsp;


There's a well-known distinction between high- and low-functioning depression. [One way](http://outofthefog.website/other-articles/2015/12/12/high-functioning-and-low-functioning) to define it would go like that:


*""A High-Functioning Personality-Disordered Individual is one who is able to conceal their dysfunctional behavior in certain public settings and maintain a positive public or professional profile while exposing their negative traits to family members behind closed doors"".*


*""A Low-Functioning Personality-Disordered Individual is one who is unable to conceal their dysfunctional behavior from public view or maintain a positive public or professional profile"".*


The definitions aren't perfect and definitely allow for some nitpicking, but we all get it, so they'll do.


&amp;nbsp;


When thinking once about myself it stroke me that I fit in neither of the two types particularly well. I definitely don't have a low-functioning variety for in general I handle basic societal responsibilities mostly okay. I can empathise deeply with many stories of depressed individuals that can be found of this subreddit: people sitting all day doing nothing, crying, staring blankly into the wall or playing videogames, but I empathise more with the subjective side of things - I certainly feel in the very similar way and want to do the same.


But when it comes to my real behavior I tend to actually do things and even when I am way down in the procrastination pit, I still don't lie around doing nothing. I move around, doing nothing. And the moment I surface again I presently start acting all energised and moving. Even the gait shows. Even the size of this post shows.


&amp;nbsp;


So I guess some part of my personality prevents me from becoming a low-functioning depressee. But my understanding of a high-functioning individual is that he's got everything going on well for him. But only on the outside and in his subjective reality he's as bitter and miserable as they come. So a person has a good career, a family, a hobby, some friends etc., all in all he has achieved some significant things in his life, but despite that he's depressed.


Well, I'm not that. Despite not being a low-functioning individual I can't really think of myself as a high-functioning one. For I don't have any of these achievements. Moreover in spite of my prolonged attempts to achieve goals I set out for me, I failed too many times to count. And the goals aren't some ""marathons"" just ""hundred meter dashes"" mostly. Writing this post has taken **weeks** (no exaggeration) of real-time. The reasons for that are painfully obvious: procrastination, inconsistency in applying efforts, anhedonia, inability to bring myself to do things that are scary or unpleasant.


And it's not like my depression doesn't show. It shows alright. So because I don't have any objective achievements, can't achieve normal life (or anything significant really), and even performing basic tasks are so taxing that I constantly drop a task or two only to force myself to pick them up again after sometime, because of all these things and the fact that I am not considered normal by others I don't really think I'm a high-functioning depressee. So I'm medium-functioning.


&amp;nbsp;


Two counterarguments can be brought up against my reasoning:


a) You don't have to be highly successful to be high-functioning. All you have to do is not break down and apart completely as you move through the motions of life.


Well, that only supports my argument actually. That means that there are 3 kinds of depressed people: 1) those who've broken apart (lying in bed, doing nothing), 2) those who go through life functioning, but whose live are empty (objectively so: no family, no friends, no hobbies, no vacations, no goals, no nothing), 3) Those who have ostensibly decent life, but who still consider their lives and themselves to be meaningless and worthless and suffer from it. Guys in the 2nd group are medium-functioning, that's all I'm saying.


b) I'm actually rather successful for someone who's depressed, just don't value it (as is typical for people like me).


Well, no, I don't think I'm objectively successful. It's an important difference. A person might be a millionaire celebrity and still be depressed. His suffering would be real to him, but his success would be real to everyone. So it's possible to measure objective ""goodness"" of someone's life (even if it doesn't translate into subjective quality of it). My life is objectively bad, so I can safely say that it's not all in my head (although a big chunk is there).


&amp;nbsp;


P.S. Please, don't interpret my post as some sort of ranking (this type of depression is more important (more hard to bear) than other. It was never my intent, this is a non-judgemental classification, it all comes down to what happens on the inside of the inside of our heads, and there is no objective way to measure suffering.


P.P.S. All in all I don't like the strength of my argument. Seems flimsy to me. And I used to be really good at arguing my point. Oh well. Should post it anyway, I guess, on the infinitesimal off-chance that it could help me with depression.


P.P.P.S. Obligatory ""I'm one of you"" part: life for me is complete and worthless shit, the agony of my everyday existence would be enough to make a Norman Normington go amok, gouging their eyes out and the only thing I can realistically wish for in my life is to commit suicide.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Is there medium-functioning depression?

Wouldn't it be easier to just die and give up? What is the point of existing if you aren't happy? I am not alive; I am existing.

I'm not going to kill myself or anything, just getting some shit off my chest. Need a place to talk where people will listen.   The only thing keeping me alive is the thought that one day I will find something or somebody that will want to make me live, but at the moment I am suffering from horrible social anxiety, depression(i think), suicidal thoughts and a complete lack of self confidence.

  I live in a family that fucking hates me, abuse prescription drugs that I take from my family members so I can maintain my good grades at school and for what? What is the point of it all? Get a degree and a relatively high paying job but still be miserable.

 If I give up, if I die, If i just let everything go it would be so much easier than dragging myself around all day doing shit I don't want to do at places I don't want to be at to get grades other people want me to get to get a job I won't like for money I will spend on meaningless shit.

I rarely ever drink! people at my work keep bugging me as I rarely ever talk anymore...I ALWAYS talk and joke, I am loud, always talking and messing with people etc. I made the mistake of telling people on my facebook I was thinking of taking my life a few months back. I had such a bad day and didn't care at the time, I literally walked upp this mountain in the pitch black with a knife in my backpack ready to slice my throat...I stayed up there ALL night until 4AM, got home at 5AM with people messaging me, but I never read the messages until I woke up a few hours after I passed out, my whole job then knew...

A girl that used to work with me for 11 years wanted my phone number so we can meet up for a coffee and talk about things, it took me almost a week to agree on a coffee with her. I'm 32, male, never been on a date, had a coffee with a girl, etc...that wasn't why it took me that long but I guess she was my first girl I have had a coffee with. Took me that long because I could not get out of bed for a while. We talked at the coffee shop for nearly 4 hours when we met up, then we had another coffee and she took me to the doctors to tell him about my thoughts and to get some anti depressants, then we took a walk and connected and both had a good time in eachothers company. Our texts become rarer and rarer now...right now it's at once a week.

We met up for a 3rd time but no coffee, I was feeling SO BAD!! so we just met up at the doctors office, told the doctor I took all 30 anti depressants in the 6 days I had the subscription! he was worried, took my blood pressure and it was at 200/99, so he called for an ambulance to pick me up, she came with me in her car to the hospital with me for about 45 minutes...it was her 37th birthday the next day. I actually only took 15 in 6 days, I wanted to get another 30 to overdose but did not wanna get caught in a lie, so I just kept the lie up. 

A few days later I text her and told her I lied and my plans and I was going to take off for a long while and she wont hear from me, but she kept messaging me anyway instead of letting me go for a while, so I just kept messaging her. I dunno my feelings due to my depression so I guess that's why I started to like her? then my other thoughts were not as important, I just wanted to keep texting her but it was only once a week, only a few lines and a few minutes and I got sad. She told me we are friends for life, anyway...I helped save someones life by donating 5,000 and the woman I been talking about said I was a sweet soul and she cried at what I did and said I was an angel, but it was give her the money as I had it or know she will die. We text for 35 minutes, so was happy about that. 

No I didn't donate that money to get a text from the girl I been talking about, I've known this person since I was a kid, although I have not seen her since I was a kid either...but that's just me and I guess why people call me amazing, sweet, nice, awesome, etc. But I never feel like it...I feel like a piece of shit! all the time...as I said last week I drank and got drunk all week, and I BLEW UP last weekend.

I felt REALLY bad last Thursday and asked my supervisor if I could go home early, he said no! too much work to be done, but there literally was no work to be done, he just does not like working alone. I was trying to hold back the tears...hold it back, HOLD IT BACK!!! it was hard, very hard! I finally got home, had to quickly get home as fast as I could! once I got home, I slammed my door shut and cried for an hour, I was screaming into my pillow until my neck could not take the pain anymore, smashed my head into my wall a few times and got dizzy, then drank for the night. Get on my facebook and delete every single person from it and deactivate it, who knows when i'll go back on it...

Friday I called in sick and literally laid in bed all day unless I had to piss really bad. But I literally laid on my bed from the time I woke up at 430AM until I went to bed at 11PM. I even text that woman about what was happening, she wants to know this stuff, also text her the coffee we were going to meet up for on Saturday I wont be coming and that I will text her sometime but I dunno when.

Saturday i'm still depressed, look at my phone and STILL no text from her, and because i'm such a beta bitch I start freaking out that she's now not friends with me anymore because i'm unstable obviously, and because of that text. I start drinking a little of the 40% alcohol gin straight up! i'm a super light weight so it does not take long to get me all hammered! then VIHA (Vancouver Island Health Authority) called me and i'm depressed, hammered, crying, rambling on and on, crying even harder and the woman on the other end starts crying herself! I was talking to her for 45 minutes about my plan on trying to get 4 doses (each bottle is 30 pills...so 4 months worth) of anti depressants I was going to down in Jan, so she writes that down and me overdosing myself on antidepressants is now out of the picture...I need to find a new way. Once again I fail at what I was planning on doing.

So I get off the phone and buy more beer, I get so drunk i'm getting chest pains and forcing myself to keep on drinking, yelling out loud listening to music. I get a text from someone I work with earlier in the day and I figure i'll snap at him (he calls me his best friend), so I text him to stop texting me and how bad I am hurting and how I lost that friend. He was all calm, but i'm so fuckin CRAZY! he then later when I calm down text me saying the woman's phone got wet and broke so that's why I never got a text, she was going to message me on facebook but I deleted it. I didn't give a shit, I just kept on drinking and was ready to down all my 30 anti depressants...probably would not have killed me but i'd be so messed up! didn't care what condition I would put myself in, then I got distracted and walked to his place (over an hr walk) and forgot to take the pills...still got them infront of me! Never ate for 3 days....

Sunday i'm barely hung over, only lasts 2 hrs...I pretty much never get hung over unless I take an excessive amount, which I did. Once I wake up I take a few asprin and i'm fine 2 hrs later, feel like normal. Near when I was going to sleep I was going to log into facebook and try messaging her, but I start getting anxiety and depression looking at her pictures, so I deactivate my account again...never added her, so I still got 0 friends. She text me on Monday her phone is fixed, she read my message I text her aswell and told her she's coming back Thursday from up island, her sister is almost due to have a baby!

All week I've barely talked...I just feel like I am someone else and I don't even want to talk to anyone, people keep asking me what's wrong, so I just say i'm tired so they stop bugging me. I just want to disappear into the woods for a few years, maybe i'll be different I dunno... VIHA called me again yesterday and said they have found a psycologist for tomorrow (today), but I told them I am not interested in doing this anymore...I don't really wanna get better, I just don't wanna be here anymore! they asked if I am still feeling suicidal and I lied and said no, I just wanted to get off the phone with them! I'm supposed to suffer...BTW my mom died a few weeks ago during surgery but I could give a rats ass, my past is so fucked up! and she's part of the reason. Drugs, alcohol, abusive, etc...apparently she was really loved by lots of people and wrote a kids book and changed her ways from back then, but I can't get over my past...or the family members that still haunt me to this day.

I still hope one day it will all be over for me, and hopefully soon! I know people have it much worse then me but I can't even get over my own problems.

I have been in two different psychiatrys in my life, both for suicidal thoughts and crippling depression and and anxiety. These places were horrible, these places made me feel worse about myself, the world around me, and how people view me, the food in these places made me (and other people who ate it) sick, (the crew members had their own ''fancy'' Personal food), so I had to rely on snacks and candy I asked my parents to get me. I chose snacks because I can keep them in my closet and they are in a bag (no metal allowed for self harm reasons) and they didn't need to be refrigerated which if it was it would've been locked in a place only the crew members could access.
After I managed to be released from the first place, I ran away from home because I feared that if I show any sign of depression I will be sent back, I was on the streets for 2 days before a policeman recognized me and took me back to my family.
What happened in a year and a half after the first time being hospitalized can only be explained in me being too depressed to get out of bed, I only got up when I was too hungry and sometimes with the need to go to the bathroom, I barely showered and did not take care of myself at all.

After that year and a half I started in a new school, since I was kicked from the previous one, in a way I was forced to go there since if I wouldn't my parents would go to jail. I hated the place, everyone were so annoying and pretending to be cool. I was always alone, all the time.
Three months later I got hospitalized again, it was awful same as before, even worse. While I was there I was still very depressed, most of the time I couldn't get out of my bed, everyone was just angry at me for being lazy and doing nothing, this went on for 5 months. 

A lot of people tell me I'm a genius, but treat me like an idiot.

We're talking casually now and that's much better than not talking at all, but it hurts to know we're so distant. Just months ago she was up here with me, holding me. We'd cuddle at night and talk about life, plan our next adventure. 

Now she doesn't love me anymore when all I have is love for her. How did we grow so distant? If I didn't have cancer I'd say ""I'll find love again one day."" But what if there is no one day? What if I live and never get over her? Three years of constantly talking and spending time together. Not only was she my first love, but my first ever best friend. 

Now we're distant like we're acquaintances that never had love. That just met. I just want my best friend and my lover back. I want to love her, hold her. She's a thousand miles away and I'll never see her again unless she wants me back. I miss when she lived up here. We were long distance for almost two years until she moved in with me as a prolonged vacation. Now she's gone again. My room still smells like her. 

I just want to hold her and tell her I was so wrong. I wish she was here for me because I'm so sick. I'd do anything to go back to the days when we played World of Warcraft for hours on end and just joked about our days so far. 

I wish I could go back in time and just ""know"" I was going to get sick and see a doctor before it got to this point. I wish I could change my behavior so she didn't feel the need to leave. I didn't appreciate her enough.

Through all of this, all my illness and all of my personal family struggles I'm just sitting here wondering ""Am I going to die without her?"" You know...she's that important to me. I always thought we'd have a life together happy and best friends forever. 

Why did I doubt that she'd ever leave? Why didn't I realize I was being mean? Depression and anger just shrouded me and made me demanding, I didn't even tell her the extend of my sickness until after she left. Even then I feel like I ""guilted"" her into talking to me now because she knows I'm ill. 

Every night it's a dream of me being healthy, waking up right next to her and going to the park like we used to. Being able to walk long distances without being in pain or getting too tiered or dizzy to keep going. Stopping by the ice cream shop and getting the twirl cones like we used to. 

Happiest I ever was in my 17 years of life was the three I spent with her. Now I'm crushed, sick. 

Every morning I wake up feeling so sick, I cry for a bit because I always want to send her a ""Good morning, I love you!"" text then I realize, I realize that I can't say that. 

Just this hollow yet heavy feeling fills my chest. Sometimes I'll be doing anything at all, listening to music, working on school, playing videogames and I'll just start crying out of nowhere because something reminded me of her.

I just wait for when I get tiered so I can dream of her again and pretend it's real. I hope if the cancer takes me it's like this eternity of replaying the last 3 years we had.

Sure, the thought of killing myself had popped into my head a few times here and there, but I shrugged it off because I had hopes for the future. 
The suicidal thoughts started about a month ago. (Buckle up. Heres a story. If you don't want to read it, Skip to the last paragraph) I've liked this girl for about 5 years, and we were never anything more than friends. In May, we started hanging out more. Me and my group of friends integrated her into our little squad, we were getting super close. I found out that she liked my best friend, and me being the hopeless romantic I am, wanted to get closer to her in any way possible, and the way I saw possible was talking to her about that friend. We started talking about him, and those conversations led to talking more about other things. We got super close, sharing secrets and hopes for the future. Through all these talks it was highly apparent she was infatuated with my friend. Somehow through all of this I still had hope that we could end up together, but I didn't share my feelings because I didn't want to ruin this friendship. After all, all of the other people we hung out with were leaving on missions and we only had each other after that. We were super close and she realized my immense lack of self confidence. She thought it would be good to tell me about a potential relationship between me and her. I was the happiest person in the world. She's like an 8, and I'm a 2 at best, so I was overcome with joy. At this point she had stopped talking about my best friend, and assured me she didn't like him anymore. Depression set in because I realized I was her last resort/fallback. We started doing things boyfriend and girlfriend do. I told her my feelings. We skyped each other as we fell asleep each night, we went shopping together, we spent most of our waking hours together. More and more, I was thinking she was the one. My self confidence was growing but I was still depressed. Come October and it was my best friend's turn to leave on his mission. He had feelings for this girl and professed them to her. She turned her focus off of me immediately. I was heartbroken. I started crying on my floor 24/7, I stopped eating, and only drank when I had to. This girl realized I was sad and did the friendly thing to do: come and talk about why I was sad. She told me  that it was all a lie. She did it all to boost my self confidence. Not only was I not a fallback, but I wasn't even an option. This is when the suicidal thoughts set in. Everything in my life was a reminder of how much of a failure I am. I couldn't stand to talk to anyone and I couldn't fathom the thought of her and my best friend together, and I still can't. 
Now I find myself completely depressed and suicidal. I know I sound pathetic but I honestly don't see a better option than suicide right now. I don't trust anyone anymore no matter how hard I try. My friends, my family, or anyone close to me. I want that trust back but I legitimately can't let myself trust any of them. Everything I see is a reminder of how much of a failure I am. I'm full of hatred and jealousy towards my once best friend and I don't want to be. I can't afford help in any form. I want to get out of this slum and I don't know how.

Pretty much October of last year I would say is when the feelings started. Maybe a tad before that. I wish I knew the exact day. I should have wrote it down somewhere.

Anyway, it was just a small crush at first. But after a few months (I'd say around December-Januaryish), it started to become more than just that. I remember *vividly* one day in the beginning of December after coming home, I fell asleep with the blinds open, in my computer chair, just thinking about this person and my feelings for them. When I awoke, the blinds were still open in my room at around the last quarter of 6, and there was a very dim light shining through into my room, and into the hallway for the door was open, and then going slightly into the room across before it ended. I grabbed my phone and loaded up [this song](https://youtu.be/onzd6lkLUwA). I only listened to the intro. Whenever the intro would end, I would set it back to the beginning. I walked back and forth between my room and the room across, with the intro of that song playing, witnessing the eerie, dim light which entered through the open blinds diminish as each minute passed before my very eyes. While I did this, I was thinking of something. I was thinking about my love for this person. I clearly remember asking myself in my head: ""am I really in love"". It was as if it happened yesterday. It hit me that I was indeed in love. I had within me, strong, romantic feelings for this person. I started thinking about my future with this person. There was not a single day that went by where this person did not cross my mind. I thought about this someone every hour I was awake. I still do. I kept telling myself that I have a chance to be this person's very special someone, but after sitting down and giving myself a reality check, I'm almost certain that my chances of being with this person are slim to none.


It's *extremely depressing* to be confident about not having a chance with the person you love with all of your heart, but it's the truth. I'd rather believe in a truth which makes me depressed than a lie which provides me with comfort and a false sense that this someone loves me back the same way. I haven't told this person that I've been romantically in love with them. One day, I may have to let this person know. If I don't even let this someone know, I will never know for sure if I ever had a chance. I can only hope that there is a chance, no matter how small that chance is. I truly love this person with all of my heart. If there was one person on this planet that I had to sacrifice my one and only life for, just so they would remain, they would be it. I just can't picture myself being with anyone else. It just wouldn't feel right. But sadly, these feelings are most likely only felt by me. It's as if I should just give up on it. The only reason I haven't yet is because I have an ounce of hope left, that one day, we will be together, within each other's arms, living happily ever after.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Fell deeply in love with someone, but know in the back of my head that I have no chance."

my parents should have never procreated. my older sister is (I believe) highly functioning on the autism spectrum (and was never acknowledged at all growing up--is this gaslighting of some sort), and my brother has been medicated to submission. i don't think either is capable of a relationship. my father is gregarious, but I believe has bpd--profoundly manipulative. my mother the opposite--stoic, reserved, ocd. 
i think i have spent so much of my life trying to ensure 'normalcy' and really backed myself into a corner in the process. working to survive a home, survive feeling unwanted in social capacities, survive my brain meant that i never quite had the energy or, more frankly, the confidence to try to make a change. 
my fp is a friend, one of the few people that i have ever felt that wanted me in their life and was invested in mine. i have had friends before, i have had close friends who i have felt attached to, but I have never been a part of someones life, and certainly no one has been a part of mine. so, of course, after a winding road of self sabotage, we arent speaking (i think this is a 'nc' but bpd is something that has never been discussed, and im also horrified thinking she knows)

i guess my question is--what if i really don't have a place? my troubles are deep, draining, and quite possibly deathly. though ideation is extreme, there really is no one who 1-wouldnt think me coming to them is somewhat burdensome or 2-whose daily life, whose story, would be different for me gone. and then when i think about my death i think about how there isn't even anyone to give a eulogy for me. it'd probably be my fp, which in itself is so sad. 

people havent really been interested in me romantically ever, and though i feel like i have made real progress and want to be close to people, i dont even have any relationships to fuck up at this point. and, what i *think* is reason (grounded in this history) dont give me reason to be optimistic. obviously, learning that my mind is more out of control than i thought it was doesnt help. 

so, i guess TLDR -- what to do if i am actually alone?

I actually think its getting worse, and there is noone who really knows how I feel, because I always put this big smile on my face, because I know how its hurting me when I am sad, and have sad thinking, so I dont want to cause other people miseries, or just being an annoying emo ass, I want them to be happy, something that I am not. So all people think I am so optimistic, and maybe I am, maybe I try to see the better things in this world, but when I get alone, I cant fool myself like I fool other people, I have to face my fears and my thinking, my thoughts.

Why should I suffer and cry? I have no right to suffer, I am just a spoiled 23 years old european middle-class white male who happens to be gay, and who has probably too much time for himself. this is why I want to slap myself, like what more do I want from life?

Would a soon too be graduating 17 year old guy want to end his life so prematurely? To tell you the truth, I don't really know for sure anymore.

I mean, I'd seen her around school but that was my first chance to get a decent look at her because she was in my class. You know why crushes suck? Because girls I always get them on are unreachable. Why is she unreachable? Because she popular and beautiful. I haven't confirmed this but i'm also pretty sure she's dating someone. Me on the other hand, I'm skinny, 5'7 in height (she's probably around 5'9). My face is covered in acne and i'm an introvert. This make talking to girls (especially ones I like) almost impossible. If you don't know me I can be very socially awkward. The first time I saw her I almost immediately told myself she was out of my league (she is).

I don't really have any friends I can rely on. The only one I can is unavailable for a while, my other friends are quite frankly pieces of shit and get pissed and annoyed by me, though I guess I kinda annoy everyone.

So one of my main issues in my life is not feeling I have anyone to talk to, and I kinda need someone to talk to (maybe who is experienced but open-minded about ""love""). The reason this is on r/Depression is because I struggle with depression and my insecurities, which then factor in to my love life very often. I really like this one girl and we've known each other for a year. I'll call her Delilah (not her real name). Delilah is a shy person and because of that I have had trouble getting to know her, though there have been times when she's opened up and times when she's super closed off. She has told me that she has many insecurities, though the only one I know of is that she doesn't think she's beautiful (which is simply not true).

To save your time and get closer to the point, I'll summarize the best I can. Basically, she flirted a lot with me in school, but got shy when we were actually talking and alone together. I've never seen or noticed her blushing during these times, but we would both awkwardly try to keep the conversation going. Fast forward to summer where we texted a lot about the most random stuff, having a good time, even hung out (not sure we'd call it a date) and got coffee once, and we said it was nice seeing each other (she was super shy and nervous on the trip, but opened up a bit more as it went on).

Fast forward to now and I'm not sure if it was something that I missed my chance or what? I asked her to the movies, but we never got to go since she was busy all the time (not angry or blaming her though, she has tough classes and hangs out with her family a lot). When we text nowadays the conversations are usually pretty short, and she doesn't like goofing around like we used to. I off and on think she likes me obviously, then other times I think she hates me (part of a common distorted thinking pattern or two if you want to get psychological about it).
 
Delilah has done and said things that should make it obvious, I feel. She once gave (demanded to give) me a ride in the rain once, we went out for coffee and during she said that we'd probably do it again sometime, when I first asked her to the movies she was excited. She has complimented me several times and told me I deserved them. Recently, despite not texting me as much, she has tried putting more emotion into her texts (she rarely did before).

Sorry if this sounds stupidly obvious, it's just that I have little confidence in myself despite knowing I'm a good guy (I think, sometimes I think I'm not good enough for anyone let alone her). Delilah's done all those things and maybe some others, but every time something bad or questionable happens I start to think she hates me and I think I should give up. So, if you could spare your time and give me advice on how this all sounds, what I could possibly try to prevent thinking she hates me and such, or anything else I'd really appreciate it.

I am a former world youth champion in a certain mind-sport.


December 15th, 2013 - After two days' worth of grueling mental strain,  I emerge undisputed champion of said mind-sport; my name is published in newspapers; I'm interviewed by the press and thrust into stardom overnight. People look at me in awe, flashing me the grin that says ""Damn, I can't believe I'm actually talking to a world-champion."" It felt really, really *good*, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't Google my name multiple times over, to check out articles heaping adulated praise on my achievement, with my picture at the side, me holding the shiny memento. I was 15 at the time. 


Fast forward a couple of years. It's my last year in school. In a royal turn of events, I fuck things up. I apply to colleges with a 99th percentile SAT score. I get into my safeties, but no ivy leagues or any uni in the top 20. I strongly  suspect this was because of a relatively poor showing of my end-of-term performance and a crappy essay. With rejections piling up, I sink into depression, and I ask myself, ""Why the fuck did I pour my heart into something, spending night after night training for said mind-sport, only to have it yield nothing but superficial praise?"" My grades had gone down by a bit, yes, and my essay wasn't exactly stellar, but I had done *something* few ever had.


At around the same time, one of my relatives passes away. We were close. Depression hits me in all its glory, and I absolutely can't think straight; I'm paralyzed from the inside.


I think of myself as an utter failure, having (mis)played my awesome cards in the stupidest and most ill-sighted way possible. I mean, seriously, with a 99th percentile SAT score and a world-champion title under your belt, how can you *not* fuck things up?



The schools I had gotten into were by and large pretty mediocre rank-wise. So, in a moment that defined the biggest mistake of my life, I foolishly decide on attending a ""prestigious"" university in India, my home country. And there was another, shall we say, reckless, reason behind my choosing: that it would be much, much easier to commit suicide in India than in the US. 


 It's been two semesters and I find myself unable to cope with literally anything. I can't understand what's going in class, and, having lost all faith in my abilities, I have come dangerously close to burning out. 



I now see myself as a worthless piece of trash, a ""has-been"" who peaked in high-school, thanks to sheer, fortuitous luck. I might have spent nights preparing for the one thing I loved, but luck was clearly the biggest player; I never had -- and will never have -- the mental fortitude to scale heights in life. I got super luck that one time


I honestly don't see any point in living anymore. I have no talent, and given my abysmal grades, I know I'm not even going to come close to doing anything significant in life. This is especially true in India -- a quick Google search will tell you how messed up things are here. Grades DEFINE your life. What, then, is the point in my existence? I'd be leaving my brother financially better off if I were to disappear off the face of this planet. He'd probably get to attend some uni in the US and live a much happier life.

TL;DR I'm sick and tired of myself, my shining mediocrity, and everything that's happened to me. And I just want to apologize to my parents for being the utter failure I am.

The problem I have, is that my dear mother is coming to stay next week in my room (student house and my other housemate's dogs are gonna be claiming the sofas I think...), and I haven't felt able to tell her what happened.

I miss college...  I miss having an immediate and clear purpose in life.  I had concrete goals then, and consistent short term deadlines whether they were the quarter, the end of the school year, or the ultimate goal of graduation.  I had more friends there then I knew what to do with.  I had no money and dreamed of having a ""real"" income...  My freshman year I didn't even have a car...  And yet overall I was so much more content with life than I am now. 

I am about a year and a half into industry post graduation...  I have money, I have my own place, I have a nice car...  But I feel like other than these meaningless ""things"" I truly do not have as much..  What I had then couldn't be measured by dollar signs or possessions...  What I had was meaning..  Purpose...  Happiness.  

I had to move from LA to San Diego for my job...  And instead of making a group of friends down here...  I rushed into what became a dysfunctional relationship.  Fast forward a year and that relationship inevitably came to an end...  About 3 weeks ago now.  I don't have a group of friends to fall back on..  I don't have a social life to resort to...  I don't even have a roomate to talk to.  I've been spending all my free time sleeping, up to 16 hours in a day.  I come to work...  Eat a salad...  Sit at my desk then go home feed my cat sleep and rinse and repeat during the weekdays.  I feel like my life is going nowhere..  Every day I feel like breaking down and crying despite lacking the emotional energy to do so.  How can I be succeeding financially and professionally while feeling like a complete failure? I don't want to hurt myself...  But every day I have images of doing just that.  I used to find my relief in a bottle but I am now recovering and have almost six months of sobriety under my belt...  I know alcohol doesn't solve anything but my existence has been all the more unbearable when left alone with my thoughts...  No alcohol induced haze to dull their sting in my mind.  

I wish I could go back.  I even find myself looking all the way back to high school and thinking of how easy and fun things were.  I don't know what my place is in this world.  I have so many ideas so many visions...  But lack the coordination or attention span to follow through with them. I feel like I am constantly staving off the onset of madness. 

This falls in line with the ending of my relationship..  As much as I am lonely...  What scares me more is the fact that I feel I might just be a scatter brained and emotionally anguished intellectual for the rest of my stay on this earth.  I feel like I would rather not have potential and live up to what I was capable of than have such potential and such ideas, visions, inventions...  Just to be tortured by the cosmic joke of never being able to achieve them.  

TL;DR: I think I need to get help.  I find myself continuing on a downward trend of self worth and happiness thst began five years ago.  I have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, to the point where they have lost their shock factor and are no longer disturbing.  I have everything I thought I wanted when I was in college...  But find myself wishing I could give it all up to have the happiness and purpose I felt 5 years ago.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Every step ""forward"" I take in life leaves me less happy with it all."

I have 0 friends, literally and I rarely ever go out. I don't have a male friend let alone a boyfriend and I was a kid with bad handwriting and messy books. I loved writing on walls in my room and used chalk to write on wooden surfaces at home. My room was always in some sort of chaos, I didn't care much about organization. I love music, movies and history, mythology, archaeology. I love watching crime shows and documentaries. My personality type is mediator and I am left handed. O never did great in school cause that kind of approach never really resonated with me. I was only good at English (as a second language) and I loved learning German (third). I am in love with fantasy worlds, singing and music and I hate modern minimalistic stuff. I love the antique and shabby chic. I love rustic and calm and isolated and cozy. I hate crowds and public places. I am more introverted but once you get to know me you'll see I can be loud and a lot of fun. I consider myself to be kind, caring and thoughtful, good listener and an actual decent human being. But the other part of me is full of hate, envy, and desire to harm people to make them suffer to be vicious and vile to be rude and to hate the world. I started being abused in 2006, kicked and forced to roll over my head. After that more abuse followed and certain restrictions (what to listen to how to dress, and some other things unheard of and I'm too ashamed to post them here). I started to cut and in 2014 it got unbearable and I took alcohol as a coping mechanism, I saw a few therapists but they only told me what I already knew. I need to leave and I need to stand up to myself. So, my evil side is brought on by my depression, anxiety and so on. I became suicidal, even homicidal, I hit walls and matresses with a hammer, hit myself in the head with hard cover books. It gives me relief. The past year I started self medicating with anti anxiety meds and sometimes they help a little. But I have been contemplating suicide almost daily for some time now, thing is I am too scared. My family sees me as lazy using my abuse as an exuse, not doing anything, an idiot, parasite, filthy person who only uses them. That isn't true. They have no idea how I feel. They don't know how it feels to wake up in the morning more exhausted than you were when you went to sleep, they dont know how much strength it takes to get to shower and wash my hair. I don't care anymore. It's hard to get concentration because of depression, it's hard to relax because of anxiety and even harder to go out because of social anxiety. I want to go out, work out, eat healthy, socialize, study, keep the house clean, keep myself clean and ok looking, I want friends, I want to be able to concentrate. I cant even watch TV anymore. I have nothing to live for. If I ask for professional help again, my mother will judge me because she says that crazy people who want to commit suicide are better off dead. She's seen my mental breakdowns in the past year, she knows I'm unstable. When I don't do anything she is quick to point it out but when I try my hardest and do something she doesn't say a thing and later makes fun of me. She discredits my condition and I cannot be upfront about all this with her. She sees me as a lazy person who wants to do nothing but eat sleep repeat. That isnt true and what hurts me is that she says that when I know it isnt true. If she was caring and kind, wouldn't she had told me that she sees I'm not ok and that we can find a good clinic where I can go to? I want to go to rehab so badly if anything just to sleep and be a little protected and listened to. I know this is long and boring but I had to vent. I want to wake up in the morning and go to a lecture, it's 5 mins walking distance... And I can't. I can't. Sometimes I spend hours lying on the floor crying and sometimes I punish myself by eating. I dont cut right now but I'm so triggered as I type. If only I could get my depression under control I would be happier and I want to see what that's like cause I can't remember. 😔 I am so sad right now and hopeless. I know nobody cares about me. I mean I don't even care about me. I was so happy and bubbly and had things to look forward to but this disease has taken over me and it won't let me go. I am just curious if I get medication will it really be different and can someone tell me what it's like to be happy and have a ""normal"" life? ",depression,t5_2qqqf,When does this end.

My buddy is 32, im 26, and we both graduated together. He's from out of town but landed a job in my city after grad. He bought a house with his fiancee and they both started to settle in. But his boss was toxic. A sour woman, never compassionate or a real leader. Ive heard nightmares about her from other people in our industry. She wrote him this fairytale that he'd be signed up for an apprenticeship within a year, all this stuff. but it never transpired, and it started to get to him, which is bullshit because he's a VERY hard working, smart guy, just dyslexic and doubts himself on some things. 
Anyway i pretty much think all this is her fault.

Hes 32, no pension yet, and still making only a few bucks over minimum wage. I imagine that would kinda get to you and make you feel like a POS after 10 or more years of being in and out of school and the workforce. He started to get bummed out about work and eventually had to take time off and admitted to me he was depressed. I think he did the right thing by selling his house and moving back home, he even got a new job at a much bigger and better company, then got married and got a great new home. I'm really happy for the guy. I'd kill to have what he has in his life.

We dont speak so much anymore but i thought the new company would be good for him. But it turns out hes fallen back into depression and its even worse now. He been at the new job about 2 years and they are now being reluctant to train him in more fields of work even though hes completely gung-ho on learning them. Their continued rejection (over 4 months) led him to a mental breakdown, stress related insomnia, and basically crippling depression. hardly any sleep or food. he asked doctors for help many times and was given sleeping pills. (i was so pissed when i heard that).

He's been off work on medical leave since October and is starting to come back but he thinks the progress is painfully slow. Only after admitting to a doctor that he's been having suicidal thoughts did they agree to send him to therapy (any therapy before this point would have been out of pocket)

He just had his first therapy session today so i sent him a heartfelt text this morning to put him in good spirits and let him know i still got his back. 

He says he's still in pain but the worst is behind him. And i had no idea.

so guys, i'm just trying to help the guy, because he deserves better than this. I just feel helpless because i've never been in his shoes. Im a happy-go-lucky person thats only really had one anxiety attack in my life. He's having them every day. I found out its hereditary. His mom is or was the same way. He finally understands that he cant get through this on his own and welcomes all the support he can get. He's off to a cottage this weekend but i hope to make it up to his place in the next while just to hang out with him. I really need advice. I know nothing about depression other than the looming sense of failure and anxiety that poisons your thoughts.

The blanket monoamine neurotransmitter theory of depression is, in my opinion, bullshit. Yes, some people can take 5-HTP once a day and feel theirselves again - but not everyone can, thus, serotonin deficiency alone cannot be said to be the sole root cause of the illness. 

Furthermore, most ADs - but SSRIs in particular - have a ""theraputic delay"" of several weeks before positive effects are seen when the action on neurotransmitters can be observed with a single dose. Logically, they must be doing something else, which requires time for the effect to become visible. I've read a little on the neurogenesis theory of AD action and it seems like a promising start for further research as to why this is.

The illness(es?) we class as ""depression"" also have a shockingly broad scope of seemingly self-contradictory symptoms. Oversleeping, and insomnia. Anorexia (not nervosa), and weight gain. Classifying depression into subtypes such as melancholic and atypical is a good start towards acknowledging that these may be separate diseases with a common feature of low mood, implicating different mechanisms of causation, that as such cannot necessarily be treated by the same drugs.

Why am I so angry about this? Because every antidepressant drug I know of subscribes to the same damn outdated, impossible theory. Even the atypicals act on monoamine receptor binding affinities. Current ADs do work better than placebo for some people, don't get me wrong, but they don't help everyone. My own depression is formally treatment resistant, having tried SSRIs, TCAs, and atypicals now to no avail whatsoever. An SNRI is the only option left for me on the NHS and I've had a very bad time with serotonin reuptake inhibitors so far. 

If I survive long enough, I'm going into biochemistry and hopefully pharmaceutical development. If I can make something good of myself by helping revolutionize modern understanding of the mechanisms of depression perhaps then I won't need the damn pills to try and treat it.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Antidepressant rant.

Hello,

I am 18 yo exchange student in California and I am dating a 17 yo girl here. We are dating for a month now but she doesnt take it seriously. Except the time when we are out together on a date she barely replies to my messages, even tho she is always on her phone texting with friends. I decided to apply for a University after this exchange year to not breakup with her, she doesnt want me to apply to same schools saying that I cant choose my school based on her. She is also trying to go for an exchange year next year and she doesnt wanna hear about not doing it. Because of this I feel like our relationship is just a fun and fuck for a year for her and then adios. It really hurts me because i like her too much already and I want to have a serious relationship with her.
I dont wanna hear about not thinking about it and enjoying my time with her because i love her and its killing me all the time. I am trying to be the best boyfriend i can be, I always try to surprise her, buy her a little something, when she is not in a mood or wanna hangout with friends I let her be.Please help me, i dont know what to do about it.

I need some help. My will to live keeps diminishing. I have received some good bits of advice here and there, mostly through PM's, but they don't really help for more than a second. Sure, them telling me everything will be ok in the end is a great thing to hear, but all signs in my life point otherwise. With each new day seems to come another reason to stop living. Everyone close to me who I can't even really seem to trust anymore seems to be talking down to me through all of this. They talk to me as if I am completely in the wrong, and that I'm just an annoyance in a phase that will pass eventually. I know that depression messes with the brain, and I sure hope I'll get through this, but I honestly can't see it happening. It seems like everyone around me is convinced that I'll ""just get through it."" so they give up, and leave me alone because they don't want to deal with an ""annoyance"" anymore. I can't see my future getting better with the problems I have. I'm never going to be able to develop a relationship with someone because of my situational anxiety and fear of rejection. I'm never going to be able to develop a career I legitimately enjoy. I'm never going to be able to live a life I once hoped I could. I can't see my future getting better, and by all appearances, It's only going to keep getting worse. It seems like the only reason I keep going to lectures at school and turning in assignments, and living a ""regular"" life is so that I won't be completely screwed over If a suicide attempt fails. I don't know how long my will to live will be with me, but most of me hopes it will be soon, because I can't bear the thought of living much longer. There is still a part of me that wants hope.

I'm trying my best to prevent it from getting much worse, but it's hard, and I'm needing treatment that requires money. Lots of money. Pretty much all the financial plans I had before are ruined now because of this. 
 
I just saw a new therapist, who was recommended to me by my psychiatrist. I've never had effective experiences with individual therapy, but I absolutely trust my psychiatrist, he's wonderful and he's helped me out a lot. This therapist seems alright so far, but I don't have the time to shop around for a different therapist that is in network, and if he says this therapist will help, I have to trust his assessment. I really need the immediate help and support of a good therapist, if I continue down this path without help I will wind up either dead or in a hospital. 
 
I will be spending $700 a month just to see this therapist, on top of what I'm already paying to see my psychiatrist. If I didn't have health insurance I would have to pay $1000 a month for medication, instead of $100. I've cut back completely on my spending. I've cancelled my Netflix and Humble Bundle subscriptions, I'm no longer going to be spending money on new games, music, or electronics. I can't afford my hobbies. I was going to get a car loan. Can't afford that anymore. I was wanting to move into a nicer apartment. Can't afford that either. I can't even fucking afford new clothes that I need. It feels like I just can't afford life anymore. 
 
Every dollar I earn that isn't going to essentials will be put in my emergency fund. Everything I had in savings has now become part of my emergency fund. I don't want to kill myself right now, but if I continue to get worse, that will likely change. I would need everything I can get to afford staying in a hospital if I end up needing to. 
 
Why the fuck does it have to be so expensive for me to live? This isn't just rent, food, and other bills like everyone has. These are major expenses that most people will never have to deal with.

So finally I got my script and I'm now officially being treated with Lithium as my mods stabilizer, Zoloft for social anxiety, Effexor for depression, and Clonodine to sleep at night. 

It's all a bit much but I'm just happy to begin treatment for the illness I have and not everything under the sun but the main illness. So far, so good.

Of course the obvious, have to drink a shit load of liquids and eat with it and all that, but I seem to be reacting well.

Today I (sort of) convinced them to free me from the medication.  If you've seen any of my posts, you've figured out that I'm not in any good position mentally anyway.  It was interesting, though... everyone assumes therapy and medication is some grand solution, but I've been on just about everything, according to him.  And yet, he didn't even see any signs of depression in me because I hide it so easily in there.  Ha ha, very funny.  He always mentions that I'm taking steps, but fuck all if it feels like it.

Anyway, they decided to cut back to half dose and every single provider is going to monitor me to see if my feelings decline.  I was surprised, because how is that fucking possible?  I've been on that specific medication for maybe two years?  And yet, this year has been possibly the most nightmarish of my entire crappy existence.  I don't see how it can possibly make me feel worse than I already do.

Did I make the right choice?  I'm inclined to say yes.  Medication was a mistake in the first place.  After getting off of it from the irresponsible first idiot I had, I let my therapist and NP talk me into trying it again (what, they promised all I had to do was hear them out!).  Been through so many, so many misdirections with a few nasty side effects and god knows what long term damage, most of all showing no change at all because my problem is situational, existential.  Not chemistry, not aided by an incomplete science and a $300 drug.

They were talking about some other case where they pulled back on the drugs too and nothing happened.  I don't want to say all of drug stuff is phooey, but... tired of feeling like a guinea pig.

Im a 19 year old guy, met a girl a few weeks ago, we were getting along really well, asked her to be my girlfriend after about 3 weeks of just spending all day together and she said yes. About a week after that she tells me she loves me, this made me kinda stop for a second and think, I have never loved a girl before so it took me a while to say it but I kind of realized what love is to me and that I did indeed feel it for this girl. It felt really sudden at the time but I was just so excited that this gorgeous, amazing girl loved me and wanted to spend time with me that I went with it.

She has been in contact with her ex of 3 years ever since they broke up and she told me she doesn't have feelings for him so I didn't mind them speaking, she would sometimes message me though saying how he was just being horrible to her and she would be in tears, clearly I thought she didn't like him anymore.

Fast forward to a few days ago, she tells me how they had a massive phone call, told each other about all the things they dislike about each other and then they stopped talking to each other all together, she comes to see me after that and she leaves in tears as she tells me that he was such a great friend and its hard to lose someone you have had so many memories with. Well today she is completely normal in the morning, she says she feels  a bit down and tells me that she doesnt think I love her, I tell her I really do and tells me how she doesn't love me and never loved me, it was just infatuation. She told me she still loves her ex and wants to be with him.

I just feel fucking empty, I opened up to her, I feel like I just wasted all that energy I put into being with her.

The reason we broke up was because she lives a distance away from me and it was hard to drive there all the time as she does not drive. I work full time and she worked part time so i only had 2 days off a week. I struggled to balance my work and friends with her and felt like i never had any time to myself. I was spending a lot of money to drive there as well.

It was okay at first because she had her own little flat just are we first got together so i could go and stay there then come back or go to work the next morning but a couple months ago she moved back into her parents because the flats were being demolished. I was not allowed to stay at the parents overnight so i had to drive and pick her up and then drive back to mine then drive back the next day to drop her off, so now doing double the distance every time.

I suggested her learning to drive and she flat out refused and wasn't having any of it even though she acknowledged it would help me out. I said to her i could not keep driving and it sort out came out to that that was it. Missed her terribly and she missed me but otherwise i was okay.
A couple weeks later we are texting and she says she loves me and i say it back and we still want to be with each other, i tell her i need to think about it. The very next day she sends me a picture of her sleeping with some other guy then proceeds to blank me for 4 days and refuses to talk to me.
Finally she responds and tells me she is over me and has found someone else and says we broke up for a reason so she no longer has any feelings for me.

Now i am at a loss in life, i feel like shit all the time and barely even eat. I miss her so much and think about all the times we spent together. I feel like there is no hope for my future and i am never going to find anyone else despite what my friends say. I have no confidence anymore and im stuck doing nothing.

I've been trying to push forward but it's only been getting worse. It got to the point where I'd have panic attacks before work (average retail job I otherwise like) and the intrusive violent thoughts were flooding my mind all day. Finally I thought I was going to kill myself so I went to the ER and stayed at a mental ward for 4 days and just finished outpatient yesterday. 

During this time I told my manager I was at the hospital and I would be out for a while and he said that's fine take as long as you need, and told me I didn't need a doctors note. The thing is apparently he keeps putting me on the schedule every week and keeps asking me when I'll be back. It's bad enough I'm not working right now (I live at home and go to school, literally the only thing I use my job money for is clothes and Starbucks and other stuff) him, and another co worker, constantly asking me when I will be back, if I even want to go back. $10 an hour isn't worth my mental health

I just don't know what to do. I'm afraid to go in there and talk to him because he will think I'm fine (since you can't see mental illness) but if I just don't go back that's weird and people will be confused. It's just making recovery a lot harder and making my anxiety worse.

Feel like shit, and just want to curl up at home with Subnautica and maybe catch my boyfriend for a bit to play Minecraft.

I was so excited about the game, but now leaving and being around thousands of people in the cold and rain seems overwhelming, especially when I don't have friends at the game and I cant afford to drink. 

I feel crummy and like I let myself down by having a bad day :(


On a different note, has anyone else been on zoloft and had vivid dreams and nightmares, and felt like it made sleep apnea worse? I know I have sleep apnea and its untreated. Occasionally I had woken up feeling like I was short of breath/had been holding my breath but it was very rare.

I have no family since my Mother died four years ago. I have bouts of depression since. I'm not married or in a relationship but through choice as I have refused many chances.

 But something odd has made me aware of what is fundamentally wrong: a much younger female colleague showed some interest in me which I ignored, not wanting to make life difficult, though I was flattered and interested.

However, over the last months my feelings for her have grown as the more we talk the more I realise how much we think alike. However, she now has a boyfriend.

I hear ringing and what sounds like my family fighting saying I should be kicked out. This has happened to me the last few times I've smoke and has left ripples in my normal life. I've lost my temper aggressively for no reason, I get intrusive thoughts wondering if I'll end up becoming a murder, if I could fuck some girl if I text her even though sex doesn't even really feel good to me. It sometimes became difficult to differentiate how I'm feeling on a personal and I often feel suicidal. Ive experienced derealization after smoking that felt like it bled a whole week. Its as if I feel have two personalities. I have the quiet me that thinks he's sweet and a good talker, then I become someone who thinks he's a detriment to life and that everyone hates him and is against him for a little bit. Ive been pondering this idea for a whole and before co caused I was bipolar. But when these voices appear when smoking and these thoughts race through my mind randomly I feel as if I'm just now developing schizophrenia. I'm 19 not going to school, working at a place I hate, im always tired, I basically lost all my friends and only play video games in work. So sometimes I focus on all the pathetic I think about within myself and feel depressed and lost. I can't tell if I'm only noticing that my mood and what feels like thoughts change randomly just because I recently smoked or if I'm going insane. I have a therapist and I have difficulty talking to him for whatever reason. I sometimes think it's anxiety and I don't want to tell him about myself, but then again I love talking about how lost and depressed I am to girls at party's and stuff? It feels like I'm on a wavelength and I'm currently switching personalities within myself and I think I may have that a small amount of that too when I'm not under the influence of weed. Its hard for me to recollect my memories well and I currently am having extreme difficulty just varying the thoughts to type this fluently. I feel as if I ask people the same questions when I see them, especially if I don't know them that well. I can't tell if that's because I got diagnosed with anxiety and have trouble talking to people or if that's just the persona I chose to use at that point. I also just space out. No thought so anything just staring. Then I think okay let's focus again and I knock knock back into the real world. I also decided to become a rapper out of the blue and my personality drastically changed and all my friends that I was genuinely crazy and basically stopped talking them to me once that happened. But then they still talk to me and ask me to visit whenever I want and such. I don't know if my music is bad because I've showed plenty of people and I've freestyled a lot and everyone has said I'm really good. I sometimes feel like I love it and I don't. I would want to spend my whole life making music and living a lavish life and then I'll think that I am absolute garbage and have no foreseeable future in music. It give some so much goddamn anxiety thinking I suck. If anyone's interested I'd love to get someone's feedback on a track. I've sadly lost motivation to try to have a future with music after like half a year and now I just work at Jimmy Johns. It depresses me and makes me feel like garbage when I think about how much a failure I am cause I'm not in college and I just work and live under my families roof. I also felt like my grandparents and other people in my family have schizophrenia and that I might have a higher chance of actually attaining the disease. My grandma is very mean and unreasonably stubborn and a complete hypocrite/liar. My grandpa goes from yelling at me over the absolutely smallest thing and then be at the same time be taking my garbage out of my room for me every night, washing the dishes without being asked, puts my clothes in the washer, and can have really genuine moments when he's kind. I literally came home today and asked if it was okay to park my car on the sidewalk, which my grandma replied to yes. I then asked well can I pull my mom's car into the garage then? My grandpa upstairs then in the middle of my sentence screams ""you better not park on the street or you'll get another ticket"". I start saying ""I know I'm going to ask mom for her keys so I can move the car"". My grandpa completely dodges my response and constantly repeats that I'll get a ticket if I park on the street. It gets so repetitive that I have to yell at him that ""I know, I'm asking mom if I can pull in her car!!. This happens often. He also asks me a question, then I'll clearly reply, and he'll ask me"" What?"" I can't tell if he's crazy or if doesn't hear me cause he's like almost 70 years old. My mom has been constantly talking about the guy she's went on a date with that night, with my grandma downstairs very loudly, or she's complaining about politics. I have 2 aunts who have schizophrenia and my grandpa got heavily abused by his dad as a kid, and that grandpa of mine seemed so kind my whole life. I actually didn't believe that he was abusive for a pretty decent amount of time until my grandma explained it to me sentimentally. My grandma has also told me she would leave my grandpa if she had the money, so who knows how she really feels. I do love listening to music thought. I write lyrics often and have around 200 memos on my android and like 40 memos on my iPhone of complete songs or lyrics. I get told I'm talented and some people when I ask if they enjoy it swiftly and confidently reply back ""I don't even like rap and really like your music."" I wish I believed in my music and worked on it all the time like I did before because I think I could make something with thiz. I then will sometimes think believing in my music is stupid and that I'll never make it because of both the difficulty a c because I feel I straight suck. I listen to music all the time thought. Especially when going to sleep. I've always had some sort of problems sleeping, usually consisting of me having racing thoughts throughout the night. But music calms that and makes me focus on it and sleeping. It shuts my mind up literally and puts me to sleep. I did it more often from a kid, up to hs, then I do now. I've always been good at English in school and I despise school. I hate sitting in a desk, having homework learning about all these things I have no interest in and will never make use of. And I would have to pay this by myself entirely, so is it worth even bothering with? I do then sometimes think that school is the only way I'll ever have success in life about. That in return, is smothered by self doubts in my abilities and how much I hate classes. See my problem? I can't have this unified person that is always fluid in his choices. I see so many people around me at work who seem to have such a consistent and reasonable personality. Like they're all in character and I'm just there.

I recently told her about some thoughts I was having before. Feelings of hopelessness and helpnessness, that I was am a failure and useless and that the only option was to kill myself. I mentioned visualizing how I would do it.


She recommended that if I begin having thoughts like that again I should at check myself into an inpatient mental health facility, or at least go to the hospital. We've begun discussing possible places to go and how to deal with telling friends/family members and missing work.


I am unsure if I should really go though. I am afraid the suicidal thoughts are going to pop up again... I know they will, they always do and it is hard not to despair. In those moments I really do feel like I should be somewhere until I am stabilized and possibly put on meds. But I also know deep down I am not going to kill myself, and these feelings always pass with time.


I'm just not really sure if my symptoms are severe enough to warrant inpatient treatment. I have an appointment for an evaluation with a psychologist in a couple of weeks, and feel I would at least like to wait until then and see what she has to say before commiting myelf to hospitalization.

I've been on anti-depressants for about 4 years. I have been in contact with some mental health units now due to psychosis, and I believe I have psychotic depression, given that I have insight into my symptoms. Basically, I hear voices and have paranoid thoughts, and it is debilitating. I have constant suicidal thoughts, and have attempted to kill myself three times before, due to a mixture of psychosis and severe depression.

I went to see a psychiatrist today (after receiving an initial assessment about 2 months ago, and the initial assessment went really well and was with a sympathetic and understanding nurse). This appointment was shit though. The psychiatrist was condescending, trivialised my problems when I opened up, and showed a complete lack of understanding of my symptoms. I felt as if he didn't believe what I am experiencing, and thought I was just making all this shit up. He said that I don't seem like someone who is severely depressed and experienced psychotic symptoms, and he constantly implied that he didn't believe me, although he said he had to believe me, which was just a professional position for him to take.

The mental health unit has shit reviews from all the patients who have stayed there, and they are complaining about how they felt undervalued and ignored, and I can completely understand why now.
He reluctantly diagnosed me with substance-induced psychosis, which makes very little sense as I developed these symptoms long before I started drinking, but I know he still didn't really believe me. I need to get some blood tests, and then he said he's referring me to a psychosis team, although ""they may not take me.""

Now if I don't get help for this, it will end up in suicide. I just know it. That's why I'm so desperate to get help, and I hope they do accept the referral, and the people there will actually understand my condition.

I was thinking about the whole idea of happiness. Now from my depressed POV it's something I'll never really know. Or know when if I am actually happy because I'm sure I'll just find everything that's wrong. But in trying to think from a different perspective, that's probably what depression is; the inability to be happy. Like someone whose lactose intolerant can't and never will be able to to process lactose. Or someone who is diabetic. They can't make insulin speaking generally. Or someone who is color blind; the inability to see colors correctly. So is that being pessimistic or realistic. Just accepting a reality?

That my skin wasn't growing back right, and that left untreated, could turn fatal.

When she said those words, I had to seriously stop myself from smiling. I had cancer. The ultimate death sentence of humanity. I had already thought to myself ""No Chemo. No medicine. I'm dying. I swear"" I was happy. To die. To be sentenced to a death that's usually unescapable. I started giving away money after this. Loved materials. I didn't care about any of it. Still don't. Then I got a phone call. Two weeks after I was told I had cancer. ""Great news, you don't have cancer. The test was a false-positive biopsy. I wanted to tell you that personally. I'm so happy for you. Have a great day""

I started catching on to it around 14-15, and from then on questioned everything she said. I managed to get through high school with girlfriend of two years who ended up being pregnant. This girl was honestly the love of my life, she basically moved into my mums house with me when I was 17. Her and my mum often clashed, putting me under a lot of stress from both parties. When we found out she was pregnant I was 18 she was 17. We started saving up and making plans to get our own place.

We eventually broke up soon after the child was born and she cut all contact, blocked numbers, moved house and I find out a year later through ghost fb accounts that they're in a relationship. This hit me like a freight train and not being able to say my last goodbyes to either, nor ever being able to find out if I was used has set me back so far in life.

When you ask people who speak a certain language if they want to talk with you, they are all eager to help you on the first day. Then, they notice that you struggle a little with conversation and on the second day, they're no where to be seen. And then people wonder why you still after years of learning the same language. You tell them, I need to improve my vocabulary. They tell you, well just talk with people. You act like you've never done that before, and so you try. Sometimes, they may offer to be the person you'll be talking with. And then same thing happen. One day, they're here, the next one, they're disinterested. 

2) Work/School.

You work hard? Great, but no one cares. You need to be a cool person to hang out with, to be worth it and noticed. Unless you're a genius, working hard is not enough. Doing exactly (and more) that is expected of you, is not enough. When you speak up and your voice is quiet because you,re afraid to talk loud, you'll hear the sighs, you'll see people rolling their eyes, even if what you're saying is right. But the kid sitting next to you, doing nothing, always an hour late, not following in class and not completed any assignment is the one getting the praises. People light up when they talk. The teacher loves having them around. They'll get the recommendations and maybe a job, despite not working a single hour of the day for it. 


I'm frustrated. I hate having anxiety, but I also hate how anxiety and lack of social skills makes me a less worthy person. May as well end it now, if someone like me is not worth it. Hard work? What is that. Who cares about that. All that matters is that you're worth talking with, worth going to a bar with, or worth bringing home. Fuck this.

As a little background, (i've been a lurker for a while) I have quite a few mental illnesses including: depression, anxiety, panic disorder, OCD, and ADHD. I've been on medication for 4 years now and it's been incredibly hit or miss for me. 

Lately I've been feeling awful... I haven't felt this shitty in months. I can't focus on anything, I'm behind in all of my schoolwork, and I'm overall a mess. I've been trying to hold all of this in, and last night I had a bit of a breakdown. 

I was talking to a few friends in a group chat and we had gotten into a slight argument of sorts. As the conversation progressed I started feeling more and more tense, and I had this overwhelming feeling as if my friends hated me and were ganging up on me. It all started to become too much and I was sobbing like crazy. All of the suicidal thoughts that I haven't had for a while rushed back and I had the urge to self harm... I turned off my phone and dug through all of my drawers, in an attempt to locate a pencil sharpener I could get the blades out of. I found one and I went to my bathroom and cut after being 6 months clean... I was a bloody, shaky mess. I went back to my phone and looked at the messages that were almost taunting me, and I took myself out of the 2 group chats that I was in. Some of my friends started texting me out of concern and I just didn't know what to do... I almost instantly regretted doing all of this... and I got even more mad at myself than before. I feel like my friends hate me now, and I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I just ruined friendships for nothing. I don't know what's going on with me... and I would really appreciate some insight.

Last year, I ended up ditching alot of my classes, I did the work but three absences gave a person a no credit for their class and thus I failed alot of them. I did this to satisfy my ex-girlfriend, and to make sure she was happy, I ended up getting out of this relationship over the summer, which was one of the scariest things I have ever done, she was emotionally, physically, and verbally abusive towards me. The shittiest part is I can't talk publicly about it, and if I do, I feel ashamed. So for the first two semesters of my first year at my dream college, I fucked it all up. I did the same again this year because now I was allowed to be social with other people compared to last year and due to that I am now just figuring out how to balance social life with school life. The thing about the first year at this school (its an art school so its very lenient to coming to understandings, as long as you don't repeatedly make mistakes) is that you are allowed to fuck up alot, however the school expects you to be able to understand the mistakes you made, and change them, so the second year is a lot less merciful. It's the end of the first semester, and I am pretty sure when my parents see the grades, I will be pulled from my school and lose the things I care about most. My depression has made it excruciatingly hard to get help as well, because I have convinced everyone around me that I am doing ""great"" and my depression is a thing of the past while in reality, I feel fucking awful, and honestly over Christmas break want to go to the hospital. I don't want to let my friends down though, because we planned on going on a road trip somewhere and doing a bunch of fun things in nature. I can't let everyone down again, I feel like if I do, I will end up proving everyone right, that I was inherently going to fail everyone. It feels like the only way I can keep my dignity is to kill myself, which is something honestly I am terrified to do.

When I first started, I felt like no one liked me. I'm quiet even if I'm not feeling super anxious, and I'm super quiet when I am anxious. But still, I decided I was going to try to get to know my coworkers and try to put myself out there a little more.

However, I felt really discouraged because it seemed to me like no one liked me. No one with the exception of a couple people made an effort to include me and talk to me, most people got angry with me when I made a mistake, if I tried to join a conversation people would get quiet and leave, and I felt like I was being treated condescendingly and like I was being gossiped about.

I thought, ""you know, it's probably just me being anxious and paranoid. I'm sure they really don't have anything against me. Maybe I mistakenly involved myself in a personal conversation, or just caught someone on a bad day. I have a history of making mountains out of molehills, so I think I'm just doing that again.""

Fast forward later in the year and I was talking to a coworker I had become acquainted with. I said something to the effect of,

""I didn't like this job at first, but I'm happy I stuck with it. I'm happy I have such great coworkers.""

He chuckled and said,

""Yeah! It's actually kinda funny because no one here liked you at first, not even [manager's name].""

I felt like my heart imploded and I felt physically sick. After my shift I got into my car and cried. I felt so stupid and embarrassed.

During first 2 years of secondary school I was severely bullied, had no friends, had plans to kill myself but managed to get help. THen I changed school and built a group of really good friends, at the moment when I least expected it. I became very optimistic, my grades were good and I fit in in my school. But then the real troubles began. Went to uni but kept changing my mind about what I wanted to study. In the meantime I developed an unhealthy interest, even obsession with visiting escorts. I was curious about sex, had never had a kiss and longed for human intimacy. I kept seeing escorts because I thought I could never get a GF (I had a GF before but we broke up after a few days). I even formed friendships with a few escorts, but later I realized they were not real friends and that I was doing dangerous things. By the time I realized I had spent well over 10 000 euros on escorts. I cant believe it when I look back at it now. So at age 21 I dropped out of uni, I became very depressed. Started working but never got full employment, just temporary jobs. At the same time I start to develop severe OCD, suicidal ideation and porn addiction. I was addicted to shemale porn and that stuff made me feel sick when I watched it. Then I found a site saying porn is bad for your brain, changes your brain and sexual tastes, I thought I would never be noraml again (I have nothing againt transsexuals but shemales are not real transsexuals, they're a product of the porn industry). I was scared I would see a shemale escort and get HIV. I started to get depersonalization and derealization, couldn't sleep for a week straight and started hallucinating. Ultimately I was saved by sedatives but stopped taking them, thinking I could handle life now. I felt a bit better, started travelling, made a few new friends, even got a 'holiday girlfriend' but the break up hurt me a lot, she played with my feelings and didn't make her intentions clear. I got home and felt extremely sick and suicidal, got taken to a mental hospital after not sleeping again for a week and hallucinating. They tried to calm me at the mental hospital. I thought I was so broken I could never be healed again but I immediately started working again once I got out of the hospital. I kept working from time to time but jobs became more sparse. I haven't worked properly (apart from a 5 week job back in June) for 2 years now. My mental health has suffered. I have been on all antidepressants, nothing works, I'm still addicted to shemale porn which causes extreme feelings of shame and disgust. I'm on mirtazapine now since two months but it's not working, I plan on stopping it and ending my life. I tried therapy too, I have seen more than 10 psychiatrists, no one could help me. I believe I'm one of those people who was just put on the wrong planet and isn't meant to live. I don't believe anymore that I can ever be happy.

It's so sad, I used to be so interested i history, nature, hiking but now nothing interests me anymore. I sleep all day and when i'm awake I get horrible intrusive thoguhts, extreme anxiety, sadness, etc. I suffer even in my dreams, I get horrific nightmares almost every night. I have tried psychedelic mushrooms but overdid them and developed mild HPPD. I have so many issues, can't cope, I feel like a weak idiot for allowing my life to end in such a mess. I want to die but am scared to actually end it. I don't know what I want ppl here to say, but is there anyone who can relate?

I have this habit to look at my mistakes from multiple perspectives 

When I look at a mistake that I made in the past, in some way or another, I manage to accept those mistakes and make sure I don't do them again 

But when I hear someone made this same mistake *(more or less)* and people see it from a different perspective, I often feel like panicking and/or feel like I have lost all hope becuase i have already done that mistake and can never take it back and how people see me after I did such a mistake will have an impact from that perspective forever.

*(I often over-think on how people see from multiple perspectives on how my mistakes affected them and how they see me, regardless if these mistakes were minor or grand)*

Sometimes I often feel panicking about the mistakes of my future too  like when someone made a mistake that I am not sure if I did not in the past,  I often reflect on it instantly and often worry if I do such a thing in the future.

For example, if someone acted like an asshole from one perspective, I often panic that I might as well be an asshole in the future and I often try my best not to be one. 

It's not exactly like **""okay, I won't be like him""**

it is more like **""oh my god. what I am going to do? did I act like him before?**

 **oh my god, what if i did? what do people think about me if i did?**

 **oh my god, how can I be so stupid? why didn't i think about this a lot harder than I already did? what if i might eventually do it again? what if I might do it in the future but I already forgot that I shouldn't be doing it?** 

**If I eventually did mistake like someone else did, what will happen to me? How will people think of me?**

Jesus Christ, I know that I make mistakes, and I know that there were those times that I did act like an asshole *(i am not proud of them but I just want to look past them and feel confident that I won't do them again)* but Jesus ... I am more or less someone who is considered as considerate about my actions ... but damn it, this is not considerate! This is frightening! 

I feel like making a move is like I am trying to disarm a bomb.

Risking making one move, I feel like I am risking blowing up. 

Risking another move, I feel like i am risking blowing up as well

Not knowing which one is better is even worse 

Damn it, even thinking about it makes my heart pump and at the same time I feel hopeless and feel like it is too late",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Do you often feel anxious about your mistakes, both past and future .... based on the mistakes of others?"

Even the slightest behaviour, whether it is a real thought about me or not, I can get it out of my head

For example, I have been aware for a **LLOOONNNGGG** time that I have this extreme phobia of being stupid 

*(not being intelligent. I rather not say why because it is a long and complicated story. What I can say is that I have come from a history of being mistreated while also had a lot of high expectations from others at the same time. So I have stuck in a loop of perfectionism and pleasing others, while at the same time, I am constantly battling against my head to push myself, or in this case, punish myself at be smarter, but how I am doing it, it is very dysfunctional and makes me burned out, cannot think clearly at all and even procrastinate because of a variety of reasons ... fear, anxiety, hopelessness, lack of motivation, etc, etc ..)*

**When I make a simple mistake .. it could be a simple educated mistake or maybe talk something that I am not familiar with, or if someone suddenly at me in a certain way, I am over-thinking about what they think of me?

Do they think of me as stupid? Oh my god, I should study harder but I cannot do much harder than that because I am trying. No, I cannot study harder, I am too weak and it is too late. I am unworthy to try harder!!**

**Am I acting weird? Oh my god, I am an anti-social. Did I act in a weirder way than usual? But if I change my attitudes and behaviours, that means I am changing myself based on how THEY want to see me as and act like their slave/sheep! But should I change myself or not? No, I cannot, it is too late, they already told others how I behave**

I just gave you some examples of what I go through on a daily basis and my god ... it wears me out. It makes me stuck in a prison of my own design and I feel like I cannot get out. 

I feel like whatever I perceive myself - the slightest guess or the slightest hint, it instantly convinces that it is true. Like a self fulfilling prophecy 

*(like I said earlier, I have this undeniable phobia of being unintelligent/stupid. Once the slighest hint comes up ... I am already convinced that I am the stupidest man ever and I give up instantly and cannot do anything about it)*

I feel like a slave of both my authoritarian mind *(whatever it makes me believe or whatever delusional thing I have implanted in my head and got stuck there)* and at the same time, I feel like a slave of what people perceive me *(or what they would like to perceive me as)*.

I feel like I am stuck in a position of not knowing whether I should please myself or be comfortable with myself *(or if I want to improve in something, at least it is a more healthy and functional one. Not one that beats the living shit out of me. Or at least if I want to change, at least I want to change for myself, not for others)*, while at the same time, I am not sure if I should please others and not being selfish and/or self-centred and be a cruel asshole",depression,t5_2qqqf,Do you often feel terrified of what others perceive you and end up having to endlessly fight it - regardless whether what they of you are real or not?

For many years now, more than I would like to admit, I’ve been extremely depressed. Nothing gives me any joy, happiness, or contentment. To make matters worse, I have a very uncaring family, one that doesn’t seem interested in helping me, let alone actually accepting me. They call me selfish and ungrateful, like it’s my fault that I’m filled with misery, most of which I can’t escape. Alone and with no one to talk to, I stay up late into the night, occasionally until sunrise. They call me lazy and unproductive, even though I get very little sleep. In the last two weeks, maybe even three, I haven’t slept more than five hours, and that’s on a good night. No matter how many times I tell them, regardless of how hard I try, they don’t seem to understand that these are symptoms of my depression. In other words, they blame me, not the illness.

My sister also suffers from depression, but unlike me, she lashes out at those who make her feel nervous. My parents are more sympathetic towards her than me, mostly due to the fact that she’s a female, and on top of that, she cries a lot more than I do. I cry as well, but it’s late at night, during the time when everyone else is asleep. When I finally do go to bed, I toss and turn for hours, unable to get the negative thoughts out of my head. My family is toxic, unfeeling, and uncaring, hard though that might be to admit. I’m sure they love me, at least in their own way, but they’re creating a very bad environment for me.

I have no job, no girlfriend, and no future. After going to college for three years, learning one useless thing after another, I dropped out, certain that higher education didn’t really suit my needs. Due to a disability that I have, one that cannot be seen by the naked eye, I do not have the ability to drive a car. My fine motor skills are impaired, making it very difficult for me to perform complex tasks with my hands, such as tying knots and driving cars. From food to transportation, I’m completely dependent on my parents. I’m trapped in my house so much, often very alone, that I feel like I’m going to go insane. I can go an entire month without leaving the house, occasionally even longer.

More than anything else, I long to have a kind and supportive wife, one that will love and comfort me. Unfortunately, due to my situation, meeting people can be very difficult, if not downright impossible. I would try online dating, but at this current time, I can’t afford it. Even if I could meet people, most women want men with money and status, not starving artists. Around where I live, which is in a very small town, most of the women are white trash. I want an intelligent and worldly woman, specifically a woman who will teach me, guide me, and give me confidence. Most likely, I will never find this woman, at least not in the near future. In the meantime, I would still like someone to talk to, preferably someone that I can meet in person, not just online.

As an author, I’ve written several books, all of which haven’t done that well. I used to write a lot, but ever since my latest episode of depression, I have hardly written anything. Every week is the same, each moment another reminder of how dark and lonely my life is. My future, what’s left of it, is bleak and without hope, comparable to a lost and lonely graveyard. On some nights, long after everyone else is asleep, I will occasionally come close to having a nervous breakdown. My life is empty, occupied with nothing except silent and negative thoughts, nine out of ten of them being extremely harmful. I would just like some advice, any at all, that could help me cope with my situation. Just as a side note, don't tell me to love myself.

What happened?

September 2013, I get into engineer school after3 years of doing NOTHING but studying, taking showers, taking shits and eating. No sports, no friends, no hobbies, NOTHING for 3 years. I get into the party lifestyle really hard, I become a popular guy but I live a very unhealthy lifestyle : 3 to 4 hours of sleep a day, shitty unhealthy diet, no sports. 

I finally meet a girl and enter what would become an abusive relationship. She cheated on me, hit me physically, manipulated me, gaslighted me, made my life a living hell and tortured me emotionally, psychologically and mentally. I wouldn’t go out anymore and I would dedicate all my time to being with her.

February 2014, I break up with her. I was having troubles in college because I wasn’t studying. The girl encouraged me to cut ties with my family and I did it. I did it too with my friends. I was alone and when we broke up, my world finally collapsed. Alone, problems at school, shitty health, and now this break up. I was lost, confused, I needed to understand what was happening. 

I couldn’t leave my room. I had panick attacks and paranoiac attacks. I spent a whole week without eating because I couldn’t go out of the house. My father dragged me to see a doctor, I was diagnosed with a major depression but I didn’t get any treatment. I had major pressure from college, I was on the verge of getting expelled. My friends betrayed me, bad mouthed me and I became really alone. 

august 2014, I was working for my finals in September. I passed them and spent the months of October and November taking care of myself : shrink, tai chi chuan, acupuncture….i didn’t work for college at all. Then in December I realized I had to work for the next finals in January and gave up everything to study hard. I was miserable. Couldn’t get up in the morning, everybody was mean to me in college, I was living alone, without talking to anyone (I once spent 9 days without even speaking a word), eating junk food to numb me, using porn and video games all the time. I became the shadow of who I once was. 

After I passed the exam, I left for an internship in Canada. Instead of going out, meeting people, discovering new things, I spent my nights in my closed bedroom surfing the internet, jerking off, playing video games and eating like shit. I tried to commit suicide in January 2015. 

Then last year of engineering, failed my last year internship because I couldn’t function normally. 

I don’t know what happened but I’m mentally broken and I need to get back on track. 

I have a horrific self talk ""you are a loser, you never did anything right you will never amount of anything you are a failure a worthless human being, you are just a scum""...I am affraid of everything, full of fear, full of hate. 

I was once a joyful and loved guy.

I'm not a total outcast nor one of the cool guys at my school, I'm like somebody else, though I do other people's homeworks in order to get some money and that's my position there.
I'm an Amélie guy, Jesus Christ, I like being at the extremes, sometimes I feel like the fucking best human in the word and other days I just feel as a morbid person who deserves what's worst. 
Even though being like that, I got nice grades at school, I don't hang out too much and there were two reasons for that. 1) Since 2010 I didn't got invited to any party at all and I was cool with that &amp; 2) I got a gf this year so many weekends were spent with her. And I really enjoyed it, things seemed nice, we met each other parents etc, etc... It was la vie en Rose during 3 months, then she started acting like she was before***.
***She was a depressive person, she suffered from bullying, family tearing up, low self-esteem and the rest.
I believed that with corny days I could cheer her up, but this was beyond me, and I couldn't accept it, I can't accept it right now, and that's were I'm heading.
Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she broke up with me coz it was better to the two of us,we were in a dependence that was messing up with our lives, I don't feel the same way and you got a life that I want you to discover. It was true, if she was fine, so was I and vice versa but there's some bitter taste about it.
So yeah, I cried and all that, even I talked to someone about it, because friends, I really don't have, one of them is a narcissist, the second one was expelled and the third one simply deals with his own shit so I couldn't really talk to one of them, so I attended to the best friend of my old gf who'll be called YUN from now on. I talked to her for hours and it was kinda good, she literally made delete all the conversations and chats (700 pics) for the best, and I believed so. I did the usual, not to think about her, you did your best, there's nothing else you can do, if you really love her you know the best you can do is to get away from her. But still, something was not right, I go to the gym, and it's cool, I focus on other stuff but then, all the flashbacks and maybes come to my head and give me headaches and stomachaches. I try to be outside of the house as much as I can, I walk, and I like it, even some day I was literally so done that I was supposed to go to the grocery to buy apples &amp; all that shit but all I did was walk for 1 hour on straight line, I didn't knew where I ended, I just walked back (with the apples).
I tried to get angry at her, as a step to acceptance, but I couldn't, and I wasn't blaming anyone, I knew both had failed, but I wasn't filled, I think there's more.
So, today was the greatest day, I fed my illusion that she still loves me with this:""If I got an accident, she'll go to see me and maybe we'll get back"". So when I was coming back from the gym, I crossed the roads hoping that some car,bus whatever will hit me, anyways, it didn't happen I just got hollered, that's all. When I get back I started to think on something I've heard - comatose - so I dig up here to see how to get on a self induced coma, but all the answers were, you can't. I got sad, I wasn't thinking.
This situation with YUN fucked me up, I tried to read most of the time, watch TV, play Wii (yeah, Mario Kart) but I just couldn't stop thinking about her. It was consuming me, it's like a head ulcer. So I called the suicide hotline, the girl who used to attend me wasn't there, she'll be back on Sunday, so I had no one to talk about it, my parents know we broke up, and that I'm feeling like shit, so they try to avoid the fact and sometimes give me advice, they're worried af.
And the music, omg, well yeah, the songs may not be the same but that's not the problem, the problem is they manipulate the way I think, when I hear Radiohead, I feel hollow, like total hollow there's nothing else, other days, like today that I'm hearing Coldplay (which I detest) when I just start going back to the golden days, hoping that she still sees me with tender eyes.
I've got no control at all, and I don't know what to do, also, I'm an attention whore, literally. 
I don't know how to tell my mom that I want to search for help coz she's mad at my dad because he's pusillanimous and this is collapsing slowly. 
I'm hoping to read a comment that will actually help me, because I know that the only one that can save me is myself (and Evanescence) but hearing something from another different POV is helpful.

I'm a 23 year old college student and I've been showing anxiety/depression symptoms for awhile now. I can't sleep at night without waking up in the middle of the night with a headache or sweating, I have bad insomnia, I get irritated very easily, I lost interest in doing a lot of activities and I started drinking more. I even started to have suicidal thoughts. I feel drained all of the time. I'm currently in the Army Reserves and I don't even want to be enlisted anymore because I don't want no one to treat me differently because of my situation and I don't think no one wants to help me. 

All my life, I was always raised up to be the best at everything I do. I never wanted to disappoint my parents. I haven't been the best student during my college years and I felt like I always disappointed them. I graduated high school at the top of my class and everybody told me that they support me no matter what. As soon as I failed out of my first college after my freshmen year, all of that support went out the window. No matter what I do, I feel as if I can never make my family happy. In the past two years, this feeling has gotten worst with my best friends and little brother graduating from college. I'm happy for them but I wish I was there and it's making me feel like shit. I want to graduate from college and start my career but sometimes I feel as if I'm getting a degree for my parents instead of myself. 

My life has been shitty for awhile. Between dealing with financial troubles, an ongoing legal case against a former employer of mine and my feeling of not being good enough for my parents, I just haven't been happy. I feel as if I lost my smile and I don't see it coming back anytime soon. Everything has become so overwhelming, I just can't take it anymore. The only people who knows about my current feelings is my girlfriend and her mom, who is diagnosed with PTSD.

I was raised in a religious household and was brought up to believe that God will always be on my side, no matter what I go through. I don't believe He is there by my side anymore, but instead He left me to fight this battle by myself. I'm even afraid to tell my parents how I feel because of how they don't want to accept that a family member has a mental illness. My granddad was diagnosed when I was younger (can't remember with what) but they treat him differently now.

 [enter ramble] Now depression is one thing (which is truly enough suffering) but I am also cursed with generalised anxiety as well. It's a disorder in which you overthink on thoughts that require common sense. This can obviously lead to performance anxiety issues at work due to my brain processing random irrational thoughts whenever I am logically processing solutions to problems at work. It kills me,when my coworker laughed at my mistakes and it really hurts me plus he bosses me around too (I can’t say anything back because he trained me). I even second guessed my intelligence based on this fucking disorder. I am honestly not trying to get on medication for my disorders because my parents would be really sad because I never seem to be suffering from these things when I am at home. But at the same time I think about getting on these medications. I can come off as a very naive individual at work and suffer in my academics! because of my overthinking. I also have to fake a smile/excessively laugh in front of people roasting me because my brain can't process any good come backs to put people in their place like a normal person would. I know there are people willing to help people like me, but sometimes I think no one gives a damn enough to truly help me, rather exploit me for their advantage which always happens. I don't speak to my mom about it because I don’t want to see her sad and has depression too. But my dad is an extremely strict non sympathetic, douche bag, who I believe has started my GAD, that would rather give me a life lecture of how I am not trying hard enough, instead of consoling me and helping me out. lt's sad beyond belief that our society looks at people who want help with depression and anxiety as pussies and it makes me tear up thinking about it because I feel helpless. I didn't know what I did to deserve this. I am truly one of the most nicest and non materialistic individuals in society which are hard to find. And growing up besides getting a degree, I would also like to contribute to society and help people suffering from depression and anxiety like myself out because I know how it feels. Also my friendships suffer from this (social anxiety which I have as well) because I am seen as an extreme introvert rather than an outgoing person. Everyday seems like hard work rather than joyful. Because I always have to try hard as fuck to impress my boss, make people laugh (which sometimes I fail) in order to not be seen as a strange quiet creep who doesn’t have a sense of humour and deal with the constant worries and the “mental chatter” that goes on in my brain. I am just an innocent person who wishes the world isn’t as merciless as it is. Growing up and being a computer engineer will be extremely problematic because of my irrational overthinking, depression and social anxiety. The worst thing is when someone tells me to just be happy and shrug it off. Like how can you just shrug off a chemical imbalance and an overreactive anterior cingulate cortex (depression) and an malfunctioning amygdala (anxiety) see how society has taught us to be ignorant? Apparently happiness is seen as money, bitches and cars which is utter bull shit. I won’t lie I get very upset when I see people talking with a great deal of confidence. As well as seeing a couple because I can never impress a girl for shit and am always put in the friend zone even If I tried to because I am limited by my disorders which I mentioned above. Although, as a child , I had just social anxiety, I always was happy, had a lack of ego and always was intellectually curious about everything, which Is what I consider the peak of my life. On top of that I was had one of the greatest character traits which I was commended for by numerous people. That character trait being PERSEVERANCE, no matter how hard the obstacle was I always conquered it and never, ever gave up. Until I got older, now finally losing my battles to these disorders is what makes me cry to sleep. This is my last resort guys, you can even tell me to drink bleach and kill myself as how I would expect the world to be like with these stupid memes. Trust me, finding righteous and innocent individuals like myself are rare as gems in this world. So that’s why I am reaching out to you guys. But I am contemplating about calling it quits. I never tell people about this, due to the fear of being ridiculed but I have to vent, because it is consuming me from the inside. However, I do believe there might be a few kind and forgiving souls in our society willing to help me out.. [tears, end rant]

What's so terrible about me that people think I deserve to be treated badly? Why do the ones I care for so much do things they know would hurt me, without even caring?

Whenever I tell someone that something they're doing is hurting me, they don't care. My family didn't care that I was being abused. No one took me away. No one said anything. 

Mom didn't care that her husband was always hurting me, physically or emotionally. Never took me away from him. Led me to have so must distrust in her that I haven't told her that he's raped me. Now calls me an ungrateful bitch. 

Friends are busy with their own perfect lives. People in general are just selfish and fucked up. Even if they actually cared they wouldn't be able to relate to my problems.

Guy I've been seeing who I really liked could give a fuck less if he hurts my feelings. I once told him that what he was doing was hurting my feelings. As calmly as I could. He fucking shrugged. Because it never matters what I get out of anything. It never matters how I'm doing. I just never matter. To anyone.

I never have. I could disappear out of nowhere and no one would care. No one would come looking for me. No one would be hurt, as I have been so many times when people have left me. 

I just want to be happy. I just want to find someone who will be there for me without me having to question it. I want someone who likes me. Someone who actually makes me feel good about myself, instead of putting me down and treating me like dirt. I want someone to do nice things for me, for once. I want to be treated like someone actually gives a fuck about me. 

The only person that has ever stuck around for me is my ex. Even though he treated me so badly. He understands what it's like to struggle. He understands what it's like to grow up without love, with just anger. 

But hardly anyone else does. They can't even try and imagine what it's like. 

These people have such perfect lives and they take it all for granted. They worry about stupid shit. They take advantage of good people.. they already have a bunch of people who love them, they don't NEED one more... as opposed to those who don't have shit.

They don't know the true value of a person. 
I could be the best person for someone. I'm loyal. I have so much love to give and every day it is my goal to make the person I love happy. I would take a bullet for the people I love. 

Why is it that so many terrible people get to experience that love? Why can't I? Why wasn't I ever able to?

Will I ever be able to?
I'm just so empty. I feel so alone, always. I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life.

If the time comes for someone good for me to step into my life, I hope I can accept their kindness and not be scared by it. I hope I can accept love without  paranoia constantly butting in. I hope I can learn to not flinch when they move quickly or make a loud noise. I hope I can learn not to cry during or after sex, and that I can fully enjoy it finally. I hope I can finally feel safe with someone.

But today I had an epiphany as to why Christmas always makes me feel like the worst kind of warmed over carrion even as I kind of enjoy it. I bet this is true for a lot of people:


This year my employer enforced a longish holiday (we negotiated it to 2 weeks, including the office closures). This is the first time I've taken more than a couple of days at a time for ages and it's made me realise: Christmas completely destroys all my coping mechanisms while simultaneously overloading them.


You have all this enforced socializing and even more pressure than usual to seem perky (luckily I don't get as much pressure here as I would in a more ""mainstream Christmas"" country but it's still there) which means you have to screw on your mask at least a bit more than usual.


Meanwhile, all the structured time and obligations and objective measures of success go out the window. Everything is freeform, everything is subjective, and being away from work or school strips you of the usual obligations that you can cling to as your next anchor point.


And at the same time we're bombarded with these tinsel-encrusted images of joy and community that are unrealistic at the best of times but when you're already operating on a bloody, fraysd edge...well, I guess I don't have to explain to you if you're reading this.

For most people there are also nostalgic childhood memories of Christmas from before things got dark. How anyone can review those kinds of memories and not compare them with the present to conclude the present is sharp-edged with broken dreams and sticky with failure I don't know. If you're one of the lucky you have my eternal envy.


It's Christmas Day and I got up before dawn because I was tired of pretending to sleep, stressed out about this stupid dinner my wife obligated us to and didn't tell me about until a couple of days ago. I really don't feel up to socialising, and I wonder if I can keep up my side of the social bargain or if it'll be a fiasco where I end up ruining my family's enjoyment and embarrassing my wife in front of her friends again. The sun is finally starting tk rise, and here I am wondering if Christmas justifies opening a bottle just to make the day bearable. 


But of course it won't help.

Like we, the depressed, see the world as it truly is while the others have the mental illnesses and cognitive impairments that hinder them from seeing things rightly. I told my friend this and she was so happy someone else saw or thought this very thing. Her therapist looked at her like she should be committed. I never told mine.

And while I might distract myself from my self hatred, it's still there deep inside me. I'm sure this sounds really bad, but honestly it's a good thing I finally figured this out. Instead of being overwhelmed by a vague sadness, I atleast now know what I think the root of my depression is. 

But then I wonder: Why do I hate myself? I feel like people with as jacked self esteem as I got had real shit parents or childhoods. For the most part my childhood was amazing though. If I were to only focus on the bad parts of my childhood, I could talk about how I was bullied a little bit in middle school (but it's middle school and everyone got bullied, and my bullying wasn't exceptionally bad). I could talk about how coming out as gay strained my relationship with my parents, but again, they didn't accept it for a while but eventually they got over it and it's nbd now. My relationship with my dad isn't the greatest, but most people I know have one parent they really like and another they're meh about so I don't think my relationship with him is spectacularly awful or anything. While my childhood wasn't perfect, it also doesn't seem like the kind of childhood you'd have that would leave you with as shit of a self esteem as I have.

But ultimately the only reason I care about this is so I can hopefully stop hating myself. I think if I get to the root of why I might be able to change how I feel about myself. Or maybe I don't even have to do that? I just really want to know what I can do to like myself better because I've tried so hard and still no change has come.",depression,t5_2qqqf,Why do I hate myself and how do I stop?

Life went on and I developed anxiety as well, then finally while being on a new anxiety medication my OCD thoughts skyrocketed and I was severely worried I would kill myself or one of my friends, the mental images had never been that detailed or overbearing before. Thus I admitted myself to the psych hospital and after a few days there they diagnosed me with OCD.

I've been doing a lot of reading on the matter and have a therapist and psychiatrist - seeing the latter tomorrow about new medication - but I'm still tormented every day by this. I'm constantly worried I'm a psychopath and will snap one day. I have no motives, heck I always try to help people and want to make it my career to do so (nursing or psych technician). I have no history of ever being violent or being in trouble, my cousin killed a bug on purpose once and I cried. I try to always give back, I give the benefit of the doubt, I avoid making people mad at all costs, I give to homeless people. Ever since I started having these thoughts of violence I have cut out everything that I felt related to them from my life. I don't listen to metal music (or that song Pumped Up Kicks) because it's often associated with killers, my dad and some friends I have are in law enforcement and always invite me out to the range with them and I refuse, I don't like being around knives that much and when I cook I don't like when people get too close to me while I'm cutting something in fear of stabbing them. Again I could go on.

Anytime a mass shooting or insane act of violence occurs, it kind of triggers me back into the cycle. Sometimes I'm worried I'm not as mad/angry/disgusted as I should be. For instance I'm from Boston and when the marathon bombing happened yea I wanted there to be justice but I didn't get as angry over it as my friends did. They were all boasting how they wanted to kill him themselves or what not and it bothered me and this makes me feel even worse why should I feel bad? He was a monster. Just earlier someone linked an old court room clip of TJ Lane and I had never heard of him, once I found out he was a school shooter the cycle started right up. I kept googling what his motives were, was comparing himself to me to make sure I wasn't like him. Then I read people saying how disgusted they were and I began to worry if I wasn't bothered enough by his actions. 

This always happens, even with this post, I'm constantly looking for reassurance. I've even taken psychopath/sociopath tests online (scored very low on both of them thankfully). Yet still I worry. Still I live my life always questioning what if that's my fate, if it's not OCD, etc. even though the signs are there I'm ""normal.""

I'm a 16 year old male, who was once a very cheerful person. I even had quite a few friends, especially one who was very close to me. But in a downward spiral of things happening I lost all that. My parents are over protective, so when everybody went out at 8 or 9pm I had to stay home, so I sort of lost contact with my friends. My best friend moved to another country, when we went to high school. There I just couldn't find any other friends, because everybody was already hanging out with their old classmates. Somehow I slowly started losing emotions and interest in anything. All I wanted to was sleep. I started feeling useless. When I was young I had an ambition to become an actor or a musician, but reality is a lot harsher than some dreams. I always thought I would instantly get popular, but even after I posted a lot of songs on soundcloud, nobody was listening. I always thought I was handsome because a lot of girls found interest in me while I was in middle school, but now they don't really see me this way. What is worst, I can't even tell my sexuality anymore. I feel like I only love women because media (for example porn) has made me. At some point I realized that the ambition of becoming a millionaire was just a dream. I'm not of any religion, but I don't consider my self atheist, so I sort of believe there may be an afterlife. The thing is I can't find any problem with me. I have no problem speaking to people and they seem to enjoy us talking. All I do is try 24/7, but most times it feels pointless. I have reached a point, that even when I was supposed to get a PS4 (my childhood dream) for Christmas, I just couldn't get hype for it, because all the times anticipating something has disappointed me. I just feel that my only option is to throw all 5 cards in and hope for a royal flush, in a metaphorical way. What if my next life will be a lot better.

PERHAPS THE GREATEST FACULTY our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.

First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us.When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind’s way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.

Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying “time heals all wounds” is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.

Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind.

Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.",depression,t5_2qqqf,A road to safe places ...

How am I supposed to know if they're working if feeling sick is a side effect? I also have a very hard time eating on them. So I end up eating junk food instead all the time.  Just a handful of chips here and there a little bit of brownie, maybe some icecream. Bad cravings I don't normally crave, not even on my period do I have cravings like this AND still feel sick. These are the second meds I've tried. How many tries does it take on average to find something that works for the individual? I'm so sick of feeling like something's caught in my throat and that I'm about to puke even if nothing's in my stomach.

The problem is that any therapist is just going to say ""you just want to hold on to depression"". Why can't anyone understand why I can't suddenly go on and embrace that alternative? How harmful it is to follow that feeling that's just ignoring my problems and pushing them aside instead of dealing with them?

Since then I tried to kill myself, again, and failed, again. I stood up to the Nurse Practitioner at Mental Health, got my Effexor put back to the dosage it was before they cut it without telling me. I demanded they actually listen to me for once, and I told my therapist and the NP that I've been suicidal and out of my mind lately, I asked insistently that they replace my Zoloft with Lexapro, she agreed but she had to work it out with Medicaid because it's so expensive, I said that's not good enough, and demanding as I was being, she agreed to give me Celexa instead and taper off the Zoloft and she increased my Lithium. 

So in the end I pretty much got what I wanted. I made them pay attention to how I'm feeling, I got my Effexor dose back to 75mg, I got Celexa to replace Zoloft, and my Lithium dose is now well within the range of therapeutic at 1'200mg a day. 

So now after a few days of that dose, I'm feeling a good bit better. At least I don't think I'm about to wreck anyone's car to kill myself, or jump off the roof of the Inn I live at. 

I've also come to a crucial realization: I'm not going to be happy, no matter what meds I'm on, until I'm happier with my life itself. I'm unhappy because I'm lonely, I'm broke and I'm not working. I have to do something about that before I can expect to become any happier. But the right med combination should at least help me to become motivated enough to do the things I need to do to make my life more satisfying. 

I think the apathy is getting a little bit better. I think I'm feeling better in the sense that I don't feel like lying down and dying in bed. Things were as bad as they could possibly be, and though I'm not feeling good at all, I think I'm seeing a little more clearly than I was a couple weeks ago.

I try not to throw pity parties when I can avoid it; but lately that has been pretty hard. I have had a rough life. I was abused pretty heavily as a kid and kicked onto the streets when I was a teenager. Since I was homeless I ended up having to join the army reserve (I guess I didn't have to, but it seemed like the most logical option). The army got me back up on my feet, and I ended up getting two degrees (one in philosophy, and the other in music).

I was pretty bad off for a while with my mental health, but as I finished college I felt really great honestly. Since getting out May  of 2015 things have declined pretty heavily for me. My ex moved to Thailand in what was a pretty serious relationship and we broke up. I was super stressed from work (my commute was a minimum of three hours every day). I was also dealing with most of the people in my life leaving me for one reason or another; to be fair it was really great for them, mostly career moves and the like.

In November of 2015 I moved to Denver to live with my best friend in the world who came out here about three years prior. I was excited for a fresh start, but it really made everything worse. Since I only had him as a real friend my free time became alcohol and weed time. Even though I got a nice job teaching music I still need another job because it can't pay the bills. Things were really declining for me quickly.

This past October is when things went from bad to worse. I got hit by a drunk driver and got pretty hurt (I guess at least I lived, though I feel like I shouldn't have). It was a hit and run, and I was driving in my friends vehicle. Despite not being at fault in any way I got fucked. Hard. The insurance didn't cover literally anything. Not a fucking dime. I went to some lawyers about it and through all the law gibberish I don't know, they told me I have absolutely no case due to a couple clauses in my friends insurance. Now in addition to not having anyone I am dealing with pretty bad stress and depression from the accident itself. Not to mention that I owe about 11,000 dollars to my fucking best friend for his car (because again, the insurance didn't cover a FUCKING thing). I owe hospital bills, and all my other bills on top of it. I don't even want to look at the student loans I have (I still needed some because the army didn't cover school all the way).

So now I am in debt VERY fucking badly. There is absolutely no way for me to pay it back. My only real friend was my best friend. He decided to spontaneously go to South America for several months. Good for him, but now I am stuck in debt, depressed, and alone.

A few months ago I started dating a girl I really, really like. This was really promising to me because after my long term ex I had a string of one night stands (this was also kind of depressing to me, but I was drunk most of the time and didn't think about it).

I don't know if my girlfriend is cheating on me, but she honestly may as well be. There is this dude we used to work with that she fucked once before we started dating. He asked her out recently, which normally wouldn't be a big deal. She, however; decided not to tell him about me because ""she didn't want to hurt his feelings and lose one of her close friends."" Since then she still hangs out with him fairly regularly and still won't tell him because now she doesn't want to ""hurt his feelings"" and she is embarrassed at herself for taking so long to do it. This morning I flipped at her because it is so ridiculous to me. She says she cares about me and wouldn't do that, but how the fuck am I supposed to trust someone who won't even tell the truth to a close friend? If she is cheating, at this point I don't even give a fuck. I just want it to be over and have her leave me alone.

To summize everything I wrote there, I am currently halfway across the country from home. My only friend is my girlfriend who I am pretty certain is either cheating on me, or is just being a complete cunt at the very least. My best friend left me to go to South America. I am in a shitty apartment I had to find last second because the aforementioned friend left. I am in crippling debt. I am struggling with heavy depression, and I am on the verge of being an alcoholic.

I literally don't know what I can do. Nothing helps. Everything I do fuck things up more. I am not a fucking saint, but I try to be the best person I can. Despite my attempts, life really likes to shit on my fucking face.

I am currently planning on killing myself. I don't really know how yet, probably just doing acid and slitting my wrists or something. I really just don't see the point. I can't see any way my life will get better, and there is no one around to even give a flying fuck.

I forgot to mention this one last thing! I don't have health insurance, but I have been trying to. I finally got declined for it the other day; but there was no rationale accompanying it, so I don't even know how I could fix it. Because of that I am stuck not being able to get therapy, and I have a few outstanding medical conditions (nothing life threatening) that I literally can't get treated.

I feel like everyone in my life is just treating me like a fucking piece of shit. I don't even know what to do. I cry so much. I never used to cry. I have trouble sleeping because I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I am going fucking insane.

TL;DR: I want to fucking kill myself because my life has fallen to pieces around me. No one gives a fuck about me, and I don't see why they should.

EDIT: Just one more piece of possibly pertinent information - In the last year I have come out as both bisexual and transgender to a few of my closest friends (this excludes my best friend who I really don't think would understand). I have also told my girlfriend this. Although no one has been negative towards me because of this (which I am at least glad I don't have to worry about that); no one seems to be okay talking about it. I get that it is not the motherfucking norm; but I am trying to open up to people so I can be comfortable with myself. Even my girlfriend just brushes aside the information as if I told her about a day at fucking work. I just want to know that even one fucking person gives a shit about me. Is that so much to ask?",depression,t5_2qqqf,I don't even know what to do anymore.

The only one i'm sure of is BPD. I'm textbook, emotionally exhausting, BPD. My therapists over the years think I'm a lost cause. My current one called me 'damaged goods' the other day, that was lovely.
One of my friends calls me Ophelia.
I've been on meds since I was 18, I'm now 20. I have been prescribed Zoloft, Prozac, Latuda, Lexapro, Paxil, Abilify, Ativan, Effexor, Klonopin, Seroquel, Xanax and most recently, Trintellix and Trazadone. The last 2 I should be taking, along with another (I forgot the name, but is for anxiety) but my doctor's office won't answer my calls. That one is the only doctor accepting my insurance in the city, or accepting new clients.
I'm not even depressed right now. But I know my mind will surely fuck up my life soon, it always does.
When i'm not unable to leave my bed, I start millions of tasks and finish nothing. I haven't been productive in years. Last semester, I failed all 3 classes because I cannot concentrate. Mostly because I was a 100x a day marijuana smoker. I'm a week clean, now. /r/leaves is helping a lot.
The semester starts in a few days. I hope i'll manage. I think I will, I no longer smoke to be able to leave the house/yet end up being too high to look at anyone in the eye/think.
The problem I have right now is.... My BPD is preventing me from being a healthy functioning adult. I am the most dramatic person I know. Everyone gets annoyed of me but everyone in the world could hate me..... and i'll still hate myself more.
I dramatically moved 6 hours away because my ex fled town because of me, without telling me.
I moved away from all of my support. Because I was hurting my support. Each time I left the hospital, I had less and less people that loved me.
Pretty sure I made mentally healthy humans suicidal. People say they don't deserve to live but I can promise you i'm a million times worse.
Lol theres the BPD. I haven't been validated in a few hours, too, so theres that.

I was once part of a combined physician assistant BS/MS 5 year program. I had pretty good grades (mostly As with a few Bs) and was very active as a student. But due to an incident involving alcohol and suicidal behavior (which resulted in me being put on medical leave), I have been kicked out of the 5 year program but will be able to finish my bachelor degree next year at the university.

I've known for a long time that I have some sort of depression and anxiety related illnesses, probably since even Middle School. I went to the behavioral hospital for a week of IOP therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD and MDD. A few weeks later I went to another clinic and was diagnosed with GAD and Bipolar type 2. So I guess I'm a medical mystery but the point is something is wrong with me.

A few months in I've completed a DBT program and have been regularly taking my medications as prescribed and haven't touched any alcohol (nor do I plan to). But the thing is, even with all this treatment, I still experience suicidal ideation around every few hours. My psychiatrist has been changing the medications and dosages, and I tell him that I do feel better, but the reality is I just tell him and my parents that so they can feel confident that the treatment is working and get off my back.

In my mind I've already given up. I'm back at home and have absolutely no friends here, while my best friends, who are at uni on practically the other side of the US, are actually accomplishing their goals and moving forward. They've been very supportive and said they look forward to seeing me in the Fall, but I honestly just feel like all I'm doing is burdening them.

My parents both work and are still very pissed off that I basically threw away my future and that now I'm simply sucking their money dry with the cost of treatment. The worst part isn't them feeling angry though, it's having them feel disappointed in me and feeling hopeless knowing that every time I've had the chance to succeed and excell I've always thrown it all away.

Now I've gotten to the point where I truly believe that committing suicide isn't only the best decision for me, but for my friends and family as well. I'm not some heartless bastard (or not totally heartless anyway), I really do love them very much and wish the best for them. I feel like all I'm doing is wasting people's time and energy by having such close relationships with these people and knowing in the back of my head that that time and energy would be better spent on someone who isn't suicidal and can provide more for them than I ever could. Killing myself will also relieve my family of a financial burden, and that they can spend more money on themselves and my little brother who's current attending college.

Now this might sound kind of weird, but right now I think of all my loved ones as a single person and myself as a leg with sepsis. They try so hard to fix me and take care of me even if all I seem to do is hurt them and cause pain and exhaust resources. But eventually, they'll have to come to realize that no amount of treatment can save the leg and the limb will have to be cut off in order to stop the infection from spreading and save the person, no matter how much it hurts. 

Now, I'm not saying I'm for sure going to kill myself and if I do commit suicide it likely won't be any time soon. But when I have suicidal ideations, I don't think to myself ""what if I committed suicide"". Now I think to myself ""when, where, and how will I commit suicide"", and I have come to the realization that I have been thinking like this for years.

I have come to the conclusion that as time goes on unless something changes and I find some meaning in myself and my life, I'm going to do my loved ones and myself a favor and finally cut the fucking leg off.",depression,t5_2qqqf,"Suicidal Ideation: Replacing ""if"" to ""when"""

I planned this to be alone, hotel room, DND sign, lied to everyone and made plans; I wanted to be alone and die alone. And now, I can't lie. I need attention. I don't want anyone to stop me. It may be too late for that anyway but now I just want to spend the rest of the time talking with someone. It's weird...I hate people and neve want to talk to people. And now, just talking to someone is all I crave. Not even someone to tell me I'm worth it and other such bullshit I don't believe just someone to talk to now. I already took about 50 pills, strongest first. I have about 150 to go. I'm a slow eater and couldn't swallow pills until I was a teenager and still it's hard for me so this is taking a while. It's starting to hit me so I need to hurry. But I want to talk to someone. Also drinking. I am starting to feel some waves. Everything actually feels really good now. Idk sorry this is doesn't make sense just want to die alone but not alone.

Update - Hi everyone. It didn't work. Obviously. I got down about 150 of the pills and passed out for a few hours and then spent about 12 hours vomiting about every 20 minutes. After that I slept until now. I did not wake up with any sense of relief, only anger and frustration that it didn't work. I am still hoping the paracetemol will work but I just have to wait and see and not sure that I took enough. Thinking of other methods as well but don't really have any energy right now. Thank you everyone for talking to me; I honestly remember very little about this, but it's nice to feel like random strangers care enough to do that. And to those that feel the same way, I am truly sorry because I wouldn't wish this feeling on even the people I hate. I'll try and respond to everyone later, but just wanted to share

Update 2 - I haven't actually gone back on Reddit because looking at this is pretty painful to be honest. Obviously, my body is tougher than I give it credit for and while I have had some health issues the last few weeks, I am still alive. I'll spare the details and just say the last few weeks have been very tough but I kind of decided that either I needed to just kill myself once and for all and get it over with, or do something totally drastic. So, I can't believe I am saying this, but I am actually taking the advice of all of those annoying people who comment on these types of threads with things like, ""if you are going to kill yourself, you might as well do something you have always wanted to do first."" While I think this is generally pretty fucking idiotic to say to anyone who is at the place I was above, I have decided to take the remainder of my money (not much) and backpack through Africa, which was the place that kind of stole my heart the first time I went, for the next 7 months. I just kind of woke up one day (woke up is putting it generously since it was more like opening my eyes and laying in bed all day) and decided that it was the only option. So, yeah, it scared me how easily my mind goes to suicide still, and maybe it always will, and how often I wish it had worked, but it's nice to feel somewhat excited about something, and I'm trying not to have any expectations or high hopes although I did manage to arrange a job, something I think will be very good for me, for three of the months I'll be there. So yeah, not sure if anyone will read this, but I thought I would share. Again, I really appreciate the seemingly genuine concern from people on here, so thank you.

It makes me fucking livid, knowing that I'm not ok and I'll never be okay. I grew up fucked and it wasn't anyone else's fault but mine. You can improvise and try to fix it, but it'll never be the same as before.

You think you may be having a nice time now, but it'll be over before you know it. Someone WILL shit all over your good time.  I don't know why people do this. I fucking hate myself and I fucking hate the world around me, but I don't try and fucking drag the world down with me. I'm envious as fuck of all the people who've got their shit together, but why would I try to smash their toys if I can't have them? It's fucking childish, don't do it. Don't ruin the few nice times people ever fucking get. 

To be in that perfect mindset where you're having fun, actually connecting with people, forgetting about yourself, forgetting the people that hate you and forgetting the weird shit you think, only for unwavering reality to come crashing back down once it's all over is such a horrible feeling. Every time it happens I  subconsciously feel that maybe this is it. Am I finally happy with who I am? No, I still hate myself. I still want it all to just stop.

I don't know what the fuck to do with the empty rage I feel. I feel like I'm about to go and kill someone. Everything sends me into a spiral of negativity, but deep down I know It's all just crybaby bullshit tactics to get people to pay attention to me so I don't always feel so fucking alone. 

I just wallow by myself. Why would I let other people be my friends, when I know I contribute absolutely nothing of value? People say negative people are the worst kinds of people to be around, so instead of acting the way I feel irl, I just nod and smile, pretend to listen to whoever talk about whatever. But I never let them know anything real about me. Nobody knows a goddamn thing about me, because I don't tell them, because I know that anyone could give a rats ass about what I think. 

These half baked stream of consciousness text rants are the only medium for me to get my real thoughts heard. By strangers who I've never met and will never talk to, instead of talking to friends and loved ones that are around me out of fear of being ostracized. It's fucking absurd. I know at least one fucking person out there might read this. You don't have to comment, up vote, anything, I just want to thank you for reading my stupid dramatic bullshit. 

I'm whining like a little bitch, but it makes me feel better. I always tried to make sure my emotional responses to things were appropriate or justified. I always wanted so desperately to just be able to do the objective right thing. Is it okay to feel this way? Am I overreacting? Is it just all in my head and I'm making mountains out of molehills?

Let me give you some examples of how I've been failing to navigate the adult world:

• I waited a full year after the tags on my car expired to renew them, because I had no idea that tags expiring every 6 months was a thing.

• I neglected to take into account that cooling my rental house during the summer would result in extremely high electric bills, and I lost $600 over it.

• I have no idea what those blinking lights on my car dashboard mean, and if something was dreadfully wrong with my car I would probably just hope it was nothing and keep driving.

• I've rented a house 2 times, but I haven't retained any knowledge of the steps I actually took to get from talking to the landlord to actually living in the house and getting everything set-up, so each new rental I inquire about is a terrifying new adventure that makes me die a little inside.

• The prospect of living in a world where I couldn't call my parents for advice scares me to death, and I literally can't imagine how I would manage to do anything in life if my parents weren't around to remind me when I've been fucking up.

• I let my anxiety fully control me sometimes, and there will be 3-day stretches where I do nothing but sit in my house and play videogames because I'm too afraid to ""put myself out there"", which is already such a vague concept that it frightens me to think about it.

• I have no idea what a 401k, W2 form, or Roth IRA is, and talking about them makes me freeze up. Somebody has probably explained what they are before and I just blanked out, and didn't understand, which scares me, because they seem like really important things.

• I have no clue how to ""advance my career"" and it makes me freak out whenever I think about the fact that there's no official instruction booklet on how to do it, and I just have to hopefully stumble into a career I like someday, somehow.

Well, there's a subcategory of sorts that focuses on having the girl in the video act as if she's your girlfriend/close friend. She (and it's always a she) will usually say something to help you de-stress after a long day, and maybe something like what I can only assume to be what friends talk about. Sometimes there's cutesy flirting. The videos don't even give me ASMR, but they help when I need to pretend I have friends. I'm also taking hot showers to substitute for emotional warmth. It helps me pretend I'm getting a hug.

 If I take my zoloft, it only helps with my feeling sad. It does nothing to my depression. I still feel empty. All it does is give me the power to ignore my depression. That does practically nothing in the long run. The videos give me some sort of catharsis by helping me cry myself to sleep. It also makes me even more depressed because it's pretty pitiful to have to do this. I shouldn't have to, and yet here I am. 

Yes, I know that I could go out and make an actual friend, but since I have practically no ego, I don't know how I could do that. People usually don't like people who have no personality of their own. Plus, the point is to have close friends. Making new friends that I'm actually close to is something I have never done before. I could probably do it, but I don't have the energy or the ability to commit to a friendship. I've never made a friend that I'm emotionally close to, so I'm left as this empty husk who's never had any close friends. Damn, I feel worse just typing this out.

Last time I told her I was so low and suicidal she said that I was pushing her away because obvisouly I didn't mean that much if I was consdiering suicide.

Can't tell my parents that I'm so depressed that I'm considering suicide because they'll yell at me to just knock it off and don't be stupid.  Yeah, calling me stupid helps so much.

Can't tell my sister because she says I'm just doing it to get attention.

Can't talk to my therapist, because she says that we'll bring it up in my next session.  Last time I suggested possibly going to the ER (Thursday?  Friday?) she told me that I should NOT because I could get through it on my own.

Add to that I can't take time off work because I won't get paid for it.  And if I don't get paid, I won't be able to pay my bills. And if I can't pay my bills, I'll lose my house.  Which in turn means I'll lose everything.

I put my fist through a wall... and I'm trying to be a supportive husband and pretend everything is great in my head so I can be there for her.

How do you decide to help yourself?  When do you say ""I don't care what other people think, I'm going to the ER.""  Last time I went inpatient it was when I put a gun to my head and realized there was something very VERY wrong going on in my head.

I guess, in at least part of my mind, I'm more interested in helping others with the illusion that everything is fine.  Maybe the day I actually try and hang myself.  Or I put another gun to my head...  I'm not sure.  I'm also not sure I care anymore.",depression,t5_2qqqf,I'm so conflicted...

This post is mainly meant as a central source for people looking after me, and I am really, really thankful for all of your support. I am with my boyfriend currently, and I am crying while writing this, reading your PMs and your hate messages too.

Now, what happened for the people who clicked on this without knowing me previously, here's a synopsis:

- Ever since I was around 10, I have been emotionally abused by my parents and family. I was there to blame when my sister died, and for, like, everything else as well. I have not been physically abused, but emotionally dragged down. Grades were always ""too low"", I was ""too lazy"" and ""too idiotic for life"", stuff like that. I've been sad for a long time, and I've been diagnosed chronic depression at that time as well. My parents basically said that I just have to think happier and that was that topic.

- Entirely unrelated, I've gotten into the BDSM underground subculture at about 12, guided by the magical interwebz. Now, if you're a horny 12 years old boy, you look for other boys to share your kink with - I met a lot of paedo- and hebephiles, and while there never was anything sexual, I made a few pretty great friends who have helped me throughout this entire time.

- Now, I've been very active in political activism lately, as I just turned 16. That is, both on Reddit and in real life. I've joined a paedophilia support group and debated strangers here on Reddit. You can imagine how that went.

- Now, about three months ago, I was fed up. Not only the debates on Reddit, but anxiousness in school, bullying, hate comments, trouble in my relationship and much more really tugged on my nerves, and in one of my typical fits of depression, I posted on /r/SuicideWatch ( https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5ejebf/alright_bye_then_keep_this_up_for_future_reference/ ), and proceeded to jump from our balcony in our living complex. I also wrote a goodbye letter, but it really wasn't that representative, as an afterthought.

Thankfully, my wonderful boyfriend and my not-that-wonderful parents immediately got me into hospital via emergency services.
Two broken ribs and a brain concussion. I've also been put into therapy.

**Now**, after three months, I feel courageous enough to come back to Reddit for a few hours/minutes a day, mainly just to say ""thanks"" to the many people who messaged me and cared about me all of this time, and ""fuck you"" to those who still sent me hate messages after all this drama.

It's been heartwarming how much you showed support, even if my stances on some things are absolutely horrid for y'all, and I really, really want to thank anyone who helped me (in retrospective) through these times.

I am currently writing this from hospital still, and I will check this regularily!
Thanks a lot, and warm greetings! &lt;3",depression,t5_2qqqf,"So, I guess, after I had 84 unread PM's on here during the past few months, I guess I can update y'all."

Today I was ready to commit suicide. I was thinking, that I couldn't make it tommorow. When I woke up, I was certain, that I can't get through this day.

I've forced myself to take a shower and go out for a walk. I've visited a local shop and bought myself some good quality tea, to cheer me up a little. I've talked for a while to the owner, but then anxiety hit me pretty hard. I came back home, did myself that new tea and at this point I was sure I will end my life. Pretty strong anxiety about my current situation, made me very suicidal, and combined with all the pain I have, I was sure I'm going to kill myself. After speaking to some people from SuicideWatch and other guys from reddit, I've forced myself to make some food and shove it down my throat. I also played some guitar and I'm planning on doing a small workout. Maybe a few pushups or something like that.

It may sound pretty cheesy, stupid, exaggerated or something, but... I feel somehow proud of myself. Maybe it wasn't much, but it was hard to even get out of bed, and doing all this things makes me feel a little bit better. I hope tomorrow I can keep it up, no matter how hard it would be.

I was in a relationship with a girl for 3.5 years, we were eachother's first everything. Her and I experienced euphoric highs together and crushing lows, with the lowest of them all leading to me breaking up with her, and not realizing that I should've kept her. 

Backstory:
Her and I go to the same college together, but I live off campus and she lives on campus. I slept in her dorm one day with my phone out of my pocket, and a notification for Snapchat was on my screen. I get spam all the time on SC and I just chalk it up to me signing up for something that I don't remember. The spam consists of bots that act like women trying to get me onto a camgirl website. My ex saw this and freaked out and accused me of cheating. Obviously denying it, I told her I didn't want to deal with this because it was a ridiculous claim that had no base. She went home for the weekend and I ignored her profusely because I was trying to have a decent weekend to myself. But whenever she comes back, she flips out and accuses me of all the same stuff from before. I told her that I wanted to break up with her because of how crazy she was being, and then shit started to get bad. Since I did that, she wasn't pulling any strings and whenever I was leaving college, she blocked my car with her body and refused to let me leave unless I talked to her and read her note she wanted to give me. Up until that point, I was shakey about leaving, but that solidified it. 

These kinds of things happened for a while. Her and I broke up in October. She kept on trying to get back with me and I wouldn't have it. Her and I had a relationship where she would always find something wrong with what I did and I'd have to grovel back to her and tell her that I'm sorry. But her realizing she messed up and groveling back to me was extremely satisfying, and it made me realize that I'm a sadist. The crying over me, the pathetic attempts at trying to get me back, it made me feel good. She broke down one time in November and I decided I couldn't see her like this anymore, so I told her I wanted to try it again. But whenever I tried it again, I realized that I might've gotten into something I couldn't get out of again, so I left. 

Her and I had a pregnancy scare after that time we spent together, and it turned out to be false. But during that time, I said some of the most vile and repulsive shit to her and she did the same as well, with me being the victor in terms of hatefulness. After we got over this, she blocked me on social media, started talking to another guy and is doing so much more social shit with him than she ever did with me. And at that point, I realized that she really did want to change for me, and I messed up so damn bad. I want her back so bad, but it kills me knowing that I completely fucked someone up with what I said and that she wants nothing to do with me anymore. She would give me the world if she could, but I completely fucked it up and shoved her away,",depression,t5_2qqqf,When you lose the only girl that would give you the world.

I just finished college. Those 3 past years were marked by apathy, living alone, missing classes and doing nothing else than playing video games, jerking off to porn and eating ice cream every day. I could beat depression and major illness on my own, and to still get my engineering degree. But it left me broken.

Fast forward 5 months (now), and I’ve healed physically, but I face major challenges. I have to get a job and get a job fast (engineering, Food Science) but…I can’t do it. I’ve sent 20 resumes in 5 months. I just don’t care. I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know what I want to be. I spend my days on the computer, numbing myself from reality. I have no drive anymore and I have kind of accepted that I’m going to become homeless. During those three years in college I convinced myself I was a huge loser and developed a very negative self talk which convinced me I’m going to be homeless and die soon. So I spend my time thinking about it and preparing mentally, instead of working to get a job.

Overall, all I can say is I don’t care. I don’t care about finding a job. I don’t even care enough to do things that I would enjoy. I have no friends, I’ve been living alone for years now. It has been 3 years last week that I had sex and nobody had hold me or hugged me or told they liked me in those 3 years.

I have lost the intrinsic desire to move forward and to achieve things. I was once driven and motivated but I don’t see a point in anything now, and I have no clear vision of my future except homelessness and death (I tried to commit suicide in January 2015). I don’t even care about my hygiene or eating right or cleaning my room. I don’t do sports.

To put it in a nutshell: I know I should get a job but I don’t care about anything, and I don’t do anything with my time. Because I have no goal. I’m not driven. I have no reason to do anything. I know I don’t have much time left until my enumployment time gets too big to find a job but I don’t care. I go through life like a ghost, doing whatever presents itself to me. I lose myself in the internet and in my head. I do what people tell me to do but I don't do anything after deciding for it myself.",mentalhealth,t5_2qirg,I posted this on the get disciplined sub and got told I am depressed. What do you think?

Also I myself have dealt with depression within grades 10-12, albeit fairly mild; so I can try to understand what she's going through, but I know I'll never truly understand or know how to help, that's why I'm coming here. It also needs to be known that she's been going through some pretty shitty medical things at the moment, the past couple months have left her dealing with crippling abdominal pain and getting multiple ultrasounds by different doctors, they have a few ideas of what it could be but have left her guessing, leaving her to pretty rationally consider the worst options, which also includes infertility. This is important later.

My girlfriend (18F) and I (18M) are both in our first year of university. Last night, she was planning to go out with some people in our mutual friend group, while I stayed in my room and gamed with my friends. She got pretty drunk however and couldn't go, so my friends came and got me to help take care of her when they left. 

She (very drunkenly) confessed to me, in tears, that she feels terrible that the people in her life are being affected by her own problems. She's been overwhelmed with work and all this medical stuff, leading one of her friends to ask her if he's been annoying her recently. This very clearly affected her. She wishes she could be in control of her situation and her life, and the fact that she can't kills her. This stemmed into the possibility that she may not be able to have children, and that she worries for the future, specifically with us, and that if she can't have kids then there isn't a future for us, simply because I don't deserve to be with someone such as herself because she'll just drag me down and it isn't fair (these are her own words). Obviously children are *years* away, and the fact that children are being discussed in university is ridiculous, but she's a very thoughtful person and it still bothered her. She said she loves me very much and doesn't want to lose me, but basically if she can't provide these things in the future then there's no point in going on.

Obviously uni can get pretty stressful at times, however her major's course load is so much heavier than mine, and I believe that is a contributing factor as to why she is so stressed and depressed. She never seems to have time for herself, between her workload and trying to maintain her relationships with people, because if she didn't she'd just feel more terrible that she wasn't making the time for the people in her life.

She also told me the only reason that she's still alive right now is her father, and that she wishes she could just die. She has been feeling this way for years. I asked her if she's ever told anyone before and she said she hasn't, and it makes her feel even worse because she knows no one would be able to help her, no matter how hard they try, and that she recognizes that they're trying but ultimately nothing could ever come from it. It doesn't help that she's in the medical field; she said that if she goes to therapy they could take away her medical license in the future (is there any truth to this?) so she has to deal with this on her own (again this is what she said). 

To reiterate, I know I'm not going to be able to ""cure"" her depression. Depression is a long and tough battle, but I want to be as supportive as I can. She's a very smart person, and all I could think of last night was ""everything's going to be alright"", which was obviously shut down, because there's no way to know that. I reinforced how much I love her and how happy she makes me, which she countered by saying this shouldn't make me happy. I've never really been good at consoling people, and seeing as how rational and smart she is, it's pretty difficult. I just want her to feel better, what else can I do to basically help her understand that I'm here for her, that we're going to get through this together, but most importantly get her help? It's hard to relate to her right now with all the things she's going through.

I'll probably edit this post as I remember any more information from last night or if I have any thoughts, but that's the most of it. Thanks guys.

Nothing is right anymore, not just that but I have nothing to look forward to, nor do I feel that I have anything in my life that is worth me continuing.

I've constantly been in education, never had a break (I'm 23). Went from school, to university, to a postgrad which I finished in September, and since then I've been lost.

I ended up getting a job in McDonald's in November, and I've been trying as much as I can to find something else, but I've had no luck. My job is shit and I feel like I'm wasting my life and my skills. I'm still trying, even today I applied for more jobs. But I feel hopeless and stuck.

On top of this I've just found out the guy I've been seeing for close to a year is still on tinder. I've been wondering why he's been ignoring me lately and I guess that's why. I'm quite heartbroken, I'm in love with him. He knows how I feel, he didn't say he felt the same so I suppose it's my own fault, I should have just seen then that I'm nothing to him.

I've also managed to push away all of my friends, and my parents are not people I can talk to, my sister is away at university so I don't have her around anymore. I feel completely alone and I can't seem to push myself like I used to to make friends, even online friends. 

And finally I'm at the heaviest I've ever been. I'm doing something about it, I'm eating better, I'm going to the gym more frequently but I'm not seeing the results I want to and that's disheartening too. I suppose it's because when I was younger I had issues with eating, I'd starve myself etc so I guess I'm used to losing weight at a faster pace than this. And as sick as it sounds part of me wishes I still had that mindset just so I could have something in my life I can do effectively.

I've never written this out before and I don't really know how, but I feel the need to. Every fibre of my being feels like it's screaming out to die.

Ever since I was 6, I've displayed tendencies of depression. My childhood wasn't exactly normal, but I don't think it was that bad. I feel strange talking about this so normally, but I've kind of come to terms with it at this point. All I can remember is wanting to disappear - I don't know anything different, and I have no hopes or ambitions. I do everything out of pure convenience to make my life easier so I have to do less. My whole life, I've felt as if I am trapped in a dark cloud where time is moving slowly yet all at once at the same time.

I'm 16 now, and I think that when I have to become fully responsible for myself, I will die. I procrastinate constantly and the start of every new day makes me want to cry. Death isn't really that appealing honestly - I don't want to hurt people through my suicide but sleeping forever seems to be the only way to rid myself of this responsibility. I don't want to be too selfish, I'm a shitty enough person already. In primary school the concept of time was so foreign and blurred to me that I could just stare at a wall or sleep to do it, but everyone wants too much from me now. 
Procrastinating used to make me feel better as it put my mind off how shit I felt, but not anymore. I thought that not being sad was happiness, but it's really not, it's just indifference. If I lived a life where all I had to do was sleep, that would be heaven. I do want to be responsible for myself, but the very idea of work makes me break down and lose all energy. I guess I've given up.

I suppose it's a little bit beside the point, but I've started starving myself too. Not completely on purpose, sometimes I do it because emptiness gives me something to feel, but sometimes it's just because I just don't have the energy to eat. I don't think I have an eating disorder though, because there's no real reason behind it, I could probably stop at any time if I wanted to. I mean, I displayed similar actions as a kid as I'd eat 5 chocolate bars at once just for the hole it seemed to fill and I guess I still get the tendencies but I stopped that. I just want to feel something real again and even though I know this won't solve the problem, it makes me feel... something, at least.

I'm afraid to tell someone, not because of any possible stigma, but because of my own self-doubt. I am afraid that if I try to get help, I will be told that everything I am feeling is normal and there's nothing I can do about it because I've been forcing myself to appear normal for so long. Sometimes I wonder what would be worse - finding out there's something wrong with me or discovering I've been wrong all along. Every time I gathered up the courage to try when I was younger, all I could think about was all the adults who told me that because of my age, I couldn't understand real problems and that led to a real fear of being labelled an attention seeker. It's been 10 years since this started but I still feel like I'm stuck in the same place I was then, and I haven't advanced at all. At 10 I barely stopped myself from stabbing myself, and I honestly don't think I'll be able to stop myself now. I wonder if I'm still in the same mindset as then, really.

Apart from telling others to try and get professional help or whatever, it's not like I haven't tried to fix this. I've tried lots of methods but none of them seem to work. I just don't have the energy or patience. 

This was a bad idea to write. I feel worse than I did before now I've thought about this more, as if I'm just wallowing in self-pity. I'm sorry if you read this far, because I really don't think I'm strong enough to help myself. ",depression,t5_2qqqf,Sorry. This ended up being a bit long. (x-post from r/suicidewatch)

**anyways.. let me give you guys a bit of a background.**

every romantic relationship ive had with girls has pretty much been trash. after breaking up with my first girlfriend she got upset and spread rumours about me that reached pretty much everyone in my school(middle school). people that i literally never seen or talked to before would come up to me saying what they were told and would laugh at me. because she told so many people, everyone believed her. no matter how hard i tried to defend myself. 

the few other relationships i had ended bad too. my cousin whos pretty much my brother would steal girls away from me before i could actually date them. ive been cheated on a couple times(once was with said cousin). all of that has pretty much scarred me. 

ive had countless opportunities to have girlfriends but ive always been scared. there was one girl i used to talk to online everyday. even though we never actually met we were super close. we used to say we were twins, thats how alike we were. she went to school just a town away from me. we literally talked every day. for hours and hours on end. she would ask to hang out all the time but i was too insecure at this point. i didnt want to meet her and accidentally fuck it up. we never ended up dating though because i was scared something would ruin it. thats my biggest regret in life. i know now that if i just stopped being a bitch and just asked her out that my entire life would be different. she would have pushed me to do better in school, we would have gone to prom, we would have done so much. honestly, one reason i never eventually asked her out was  because i was embarrassed that i dropped out of high school. who wants to bring a drop out to their mom and dad and their friends and say ""hey mom, hey dad, hey friends, heres my ugly drop out boyfriend. i know we're high class and hes like barely middle class but hes suuuuper cool."" nobody. i didnt want to embarrass her. i know she wanted to go out with me but idk.. i wasnt good enough for her. she deserved the world.. and i wouldnt have been able to give it to her. so instead of leading her on more i stopped talking to her. we still follow each other on everything and like occasionally comment on eachothers whatever but we never actually talk. i wouldn't be surprised if she deleted my number to be honest. not dating her **honestly** is my biggest regret of my entire life. 

i dropped out of high school at age 16. I missed a whole lot of school one year because my dad had a heart attack and was in the hospital for a week. then later my mom got sick with really bad pneumonia and was in the hospital for a week. and then my dog almost died. I missed so much school that i was either failing or was almost failing all of my classes. And school before that was already stressful. but add all of that stress onto my shoulders on top of the already extreme stress that school gave me..i **immediately** got my ged but never went to college. not even a community college. i know i should but school life is far too stressful for me. especially now. 

ive only ever had one job. a full time stock boy at some shitty retail store. i applied for part time but when they said i got the job and called me in, they told me they only wanted a full time stock boy. i tried it out and it was terrible. 50 hour weeks. i only had the job for a few months in 2015 because my coworkers treated me like trash. even my managers. they lied about me taking long breaks when i didnt, they blamed things on me, purposely called me like 7 different names. 10% of the time being my actual name. when i put my 2 weeks in, i overheard one of my managers say he was happy to get a new worker that doesnt look like a serial killer(i have the male equivilant of resting bitch face). that entire experience has pretty much killed my urge to find another job. 

my social life is fucking trash. i pretty much stay home every day. just watching youtube videos or playing video games or skyping with friends. once or twice a week me, my cousin and maybe a friend or two watch wrestling or some show together. occasionally i have friends come over(for something thats not for wrestling, walking dead or whatevr) but 9/10 thats because my cousin was the one to ask. they(my cousin and i's mutual friends) usually dont want to come over whenever i ask. they're either ""too busy"" or they're actually busy doing something when i ask. after a while of asking people to hang out and just getting rejected or just flat out ignored i stopped trying. 

my skype friends(a group of like 8 people that ive known mostly since middle school) ask me to come hang with them a lot but i almost always lie say i cant for whatever reason i think of on the spot. the reason i dont hang with them is because when we used to see eachother in high school, i was still skinny, had really thick long hair, had ""cool"" clothes and wasnt nearly as awkward(thank u mental illnesses for ruining my life btw). now im like 215-220(it fluctuates) with super thinned out hair, have dated clothes(not having a job with money coming in weekly apparently makes you poor. go figure.), and thanks to all of my annoying mental illnesses, im awkward as fuck. social situations can be my personal hell sometimes(most of the time).

when it comes to small talk with people(especially strangers, but even with people i know), im fucking lost. i cant. i really cant. i never know what to talk about and i just come off as painfully awkward. which sucks because i dont forget things like that and i just dwell and dwell on it. even if the person i was with didnt think it was *that* bad and end up forgetting it, i dont. i cant.

i want a social life but i cant handle the pressures. i want money but just thinking about looking for a job stresses me out. i want a job but i keep thinking its going to be the same as my last job. i want a girlfriend but im super awkward and because of my weight and thin hair, im not attractive enough to pull of being awkward. i want to message that girl and rekindle our relationship but im 4 years too late for that. especially looking like i do.. id have no chance with her. and that really fucking sucks. the only time ive cried while writing all of this was when i first started talking about her earlier and when i just brought her up again. 

i hate my life. im fucking broken. why am i such a fucking failure.

Like can't get out of bed and just sleep for x hours hard but had a fairly rare non-depressive thought today which thought it might be fun to entertain: 'man depression sucks like a bucket of ****, but what are some good things about it?'. 

Here are some things i could think of:

* I find i don't have much of attitude when i'm depressed - therefore i don't have to eat as much, saving money and keeping/losing my weight at a certain level
* My lack of energy means i'm not partial to the idea of totally self-destructive behaviour which is debatable but talking about things like killing oneself as opposed to drinking or playing video games
* I find my lack of emotions/empathy means i tend to not let other people's bs upset me/get to me unless it's really in my face
* My self-isolating tendencies means i don't have to let my family/closed ones have to deal with my negative bs
* I find myself indulging excessively in my hobby of choice which is doing bonkers on my productivity and future plans but at least my backlog is kinda being chipped at?
